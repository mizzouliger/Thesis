raw_documents = ["KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, GUEST HOST: This is a Fox News Alert. The U.S. military has dropped what is being called, quote, the mother of all bombs on an ISIS target in Afghanistan.I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, in for Sean tonight.Here's President Trump earlier today reacting to the massive non-nuclear military strike.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very, very proud of the people (INAUDIBLE) really another successful job. We're very, very proud of our military. Everybody knows exactly what happened so -- and what I do is I authorize my military. We have the greatest military in the world, and they've done the job, as usual. So we have given them total authorization, and that's what they're doing.And frankly, that's why they've been so successful lately. If you look at what's happened over the last eight weeks and compare that to what -- really, to what's happened over the last eight years, you'll see there's a tremendous difference.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And at the Pentagon with details on why the U.S. decided to drop this massive bomb is Jennifer Griffin -- Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Kimberly, the cloud that results from this size bomb reaches 10,000 feet in the air. At 7:32 PM local time in Afghanistan, the U.S. Air Force dropped a 21,000-pound bomb known as the mother of all bombs, or massive ordnance air blast, on what the White House described as a complex of ISIS tunnels on the border with Pakistan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters used to move around freely. The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously. And in order to defeat the group, we must deny than operational space, which we did.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: The GBU44 is the largest non-nuclear weapon the U.S. military has ever used in combat. Designed for the Iraq war but never used, tested in 2003, the MOAB is a concussive GOP-guided bomb that is pushed out of the back of a modified C-130 aircraft. Its blast radius is one mile wide.The Pentagon says the top general in Afghanistan didn't need to ask permission to conduct the strike. The target of the explosion was a series of tunnels near a Achin province in Nangarhar province 35 miles south of Jalalabad, where the U.S. has a base.On Saturday, an American Green Beret was killed by small arms fire in that part of Nangarhar province, Staff Sergeant Mark De Alencar of Edgewood, Maryland, part of an ISIS-clearing operation. The U.S. military says the strike today was not in retaliation for the Green Beret's death.The president announced yesterday after meeting with NATO's secretary- general at the White House that national security adviser H.R. McMaster is leaving soon for Afghanistan, and the top commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, testified recently, Kimberly, that he needs several thousand more U.S. or NATO troops for Afghanistan -- Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: All right, Jennifer, thank you.And also tonight, tensions are rising with North Korea over a new report that says the rogue regime could be preparing to carry out a new nuclear test. A monitoring group released satellite images that shows activity at a North Korean nuclear site. President Trump is calling on China to help defuse the situation, but says if Beijing fails to act, then the U.S. and its allies will.And outrage is growing over Syrian president Bashar al Assad's comments about last week's chemical weapons attack. He's now claiming it was fake.In Washington with more is Leland Vittert -- Leland.LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kimberly, Assad is basically asking the world to believe him, rather than our lying eyes, suggesting videos like these of the dead and dying from sarin gas were faked, saying in that interview to the French wire service AFP, Our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand in glove with the terrorists. That's what Assad calls anyone he doesn't like. They -- meaning the United States -- fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack.In an exhaustive presentation, the Pentagon went as far to put out the radar track of the Syrian jet that dropped the sarin bomb, and the U.S. the secretary of state doubled down on the charge in front of Assad's Russian protectors yesterday.So suffice it to say, nobody in Washington or anywhere else is buying Assad's denial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT ACTING SPOKESMAN: Sadly, it's vintage Assad. It is an attempt by him to throw up false flags, create confusion. Frankly, it's a tactic we've seen on Russia's part, as well, in the past. There can be little doubt that the recent attacks and the chemical weapons attack and -- in Idlib was by the Syrian government, by the Syrian regime and that it wasn't only a violation of the laws of war but it was we believe a war crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)VITTERT: And this creates quite a PR pickle for Vladimir Putin. As you might remember, Assad's 2013 sarin gas attack killed more than 1,400 people, crossing then president Obama's red line. Part of the grand bargain to stave off a U.S. attack was Russia's assurance they would destroy all of Assad's chemical weapons, begging the question now, Kimberly, if the Russians intentionally left Assad with a chemical arsenal or were simply hoodwinked by their own proxy.GUILFOYLE: Leland, thank you.And joining us now with reaction is the author of Treason, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Thanks for being with us, Mr. Speaker.NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Delighted to be with you.GUILFOYLE: Fantastic. So a lot of news to discuss that's been going on this past week, and especially today. Let's talk about the latest development in Afghanistan and the president's decision to drop this massive bomb. What kind of message does this send to North Korea and Syria, let alone ISIS?GINGRICH: Well, I think, first of all, the decision to use the largest non-nuclear bomb that we have sent a clear signal of strength, building on what he did last week with Syria and is also a reminder both to the Russians and to the North Koreans that we have enormous assets if we want to use them.I think it's very interesting. You now have with General Mattis and with General McMaster real professionals who are giving the president serious military advice, exactly the sort of thing that Barack Obama always rejected. And I think what you're finding is that when the president turns and says, What are my options, it turns out there are a lot more options than Obama ever thought there were.GUILFOYLE: Well, it's very interesting that you bring this up, and I heard you discuss this earlier in the day, but a markedly different approach to foreign policy, to military intervention we've seen in less than the first, you know, 100 days of the president being in office.GINGRICH: Yes, I wrote a newsletter last week at Gingrich Productions pointing out that there are a lot of parallels between President Trump succeeding the weakness of Obama and President Reagan succeeding the weakness of Jimmy Carter. And they both had decisive moments. In Reagan's case, it was shooting down two Libyan aircraft over the Gulf of Sidra, and in the president's case, it was firing Tomahawk missiles last week, by the way, while at dinner with the Chinese president.GUILFOYLE: Right. Subtle.GINGRICH: So I think that --GUILFOYLE: Subtle.GINGRICH: (INAUDIBLE) useful (ph). And by the way, somebody made a comment to me that was fascinating. They said if you want to take video of the foreign minister of Russia meeting with Hillary Clinton, meeting with John Kerry, and meeting with Rex Tillerson, it'll give you a real sense of how much real power Tillerson carries just in his bearing and his sophistication and his maturity because he's different than the other people that Lavrov has worked with. And I thought that was a fascinating commentary on what a great job Secretary Tillerson's doing for America.GUILFOYLE: Yes, fantastic. You see a lot of kind of feedback, people saying, you know, how they thought that he did. I thought it was very strong and decisive. And he showed no hesitation in bringing up directly to Putin and the individuals there all of the issues and problems that the United States has with Russia.Wow, this must have been quite a surprise to all the people that thought that the president was going to so chummy with Putin and not be strong with Russia.GINGRICH: Well, look, I think if President Trump could find a way to do it, he'd like to be friends with Russia.GUILFOYLE: Right.GINGRICH: He doesn't -- and he doesn't have any great interest in going out of the way to start a fight, but he's not going to give an inch on things like gassing children, which I think really got to the president emotionally. And the fact is that Rex Tillerson, when he was the head of ExxonMobil had negotiated several multi-billion-dollar deals with the Russians. He knows how to deal with them. He's not afraid of them. He's not confused by them. And without being hostile, he was very direct.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Absolutely. And you have to be firm, and now we are getting to see exactly what kind of president Mr. Trump is. And he's being  road very true, it seems to me, to his campaign promises and being decisive and using the strength of the American military, which he has already shown a great respect for.So I want to segue a little bit about North Korea. You know, a new report says that North Korea could be preparing a new nuclear test. And if they do, how should President Trump respond?GINGRICH: Well, the more fascinating question is what are the Chinese going to do?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GINGRICH: The Chinese have moved 150,000 troops to the North Korean border. They have changed their purchases of coal and have tightened up on sanctions against North Korea. And they have said publicly that the North Koreans had better not engage in this nuclear test.And remember, if it's an underground facility, what we just proved in Afghanistan was we have weapons which without going nuclear -- we have huge non-nuclear conventional weapons that could take out these kind of facilities.So I think the Chinese are trying to say to him, Look, you got to President Trump seriously. This is not like the good old days. And you better be careful.So the first reaction ought to be, let's look at the Chinese, who, by the way, did abstain at the U.N. and President Trump was exactly right to say this was a major step in the right direction, when on the Syrian resolution, they abstained, leaving the Russians all by themselves as the only country voting no.GUILFOYLE: Absolutely. Now, do you think that it's -- you know, we can have this kind of confidence in terms of the relationship with, you know, the president of China and President Trump working together cooperatively? Because I think people are concerned because nobody seems to be able to control North Korea and Kim Jong-un.GINGRICH: Yes, and I'm not sure the Chinese can, either, so I don't think you can wave a magic wand.But what was clear to me was that President Trump recommended that they go off by themselves, get away from the staff. They had a two-hour meeting the first day and another one-hour meeting the second day. And apparently, the chemistry was very good.You may remember that Reagan did the same thing with Gorbachev when they first met.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GINGRICH: He said, Let's go for a walk. Let's just get out of here, just you and me and the interpreter. I think that that does lead to a different attitude, a different willingness to work. I think that's what President Trump hoped he could do with Putin, and Putin has simply been too difficult to deal with to try to have that kind of a personal conversation. But I do think there's a possibility that we're on the edge of some serious progress with China.GUILFOYLE: Yes, absolutely. And I think you bring up such a great point because it's that interpersonal relationship, that dynamic and establishing that bond that it appears that President Trump successfully once again did with President Xi, that he can pick up the phone, call him, work cooperatively with open lines of communication. I mean, that's real leadership, and someone who's, you know, used to being an executive and making the decisions and establishing those relationships. I think we see if you agree, you know, that this is working very well for this new U.S. foreign policy with President Trump.GINGRICH: It's a tremendous potential. It went much better at Mar-a-Lago than I thought it would, and I think that the president deserves a lot of credit. I also think, frankly, that Ivanka's children, who are studying at a school where they're learning Mandarin -- I am told that it was a very big hit in China, the video of the children singing in Mandarin. And we shouldn't underestimate that people to people sometimes breaks ",
             "SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to Hannity. This is a Fox News Alert. And we are following three major breaking news stories tonight. President Trump -- he continues to work towards keeping a very key campaign promise. He's now calling on Congress to work to pass a massive tax reform plan. That should help you, the American people, of course, after years of suffering under the Obama administration.Also tonight, the destroy Trump media -- they prove they don't care about the Constitution, the rule of law. They are in full complete meltdown freakout mode over the president's DACA decision, which of course is constitutional and doesn't usurp the power of Congress.Also tonight, the clock is ticking for leaders on Capitol Hill. Fourteen weeks they have to get their act together and enact the president's agenda before the end of the year.Tonight, we will hold Washington accountable. We will lay out very simply for Republicans what they need to accomplish. That's tonight's very important news-breaking Opening Monologue.All right, the president once again left the sewer, the swamp that is known as Washington, D.C., left the area to take his tax reform message directly to you, the American people.So earlier today in North Dakota, President Trump, he called for a dramatic, Reaganesque overhaul of the federal tax code -- so desperately needed. Let's take a look.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we reform America's outdate, complex and extremely burdensome -- I mean, this is so complicated and so burdensome -- our tax code. If we want to renew our prosperity, restore our opportunity and reestablish our economic dominance, which is what we should be doing, then we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and yes, pro-American.My administration is working with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and middle-class families all across the nation. So it's not only business taxes. It's middle income families. It's families at every level, every level -- tax cuts.HANNITY: Here's a question. Do the people in D.C. -- do they care about the 50 million Americans in poverty, the 50 million on food stamps, the 94 million out of the labor force? Do they care that we have a 51-year low in terms of home ownership rate in this country?Now, what the president is calling for today is going to have a profound positive impact on the forgotten men and women in this country and the country as a whole. Workers would have more money in their pockets after not seeing real raises in years. Companies -- they'd be able to see lower taxes. That means they can hire more employees, invest in new technologies, build factories and manufacturing centers. And just like President Reagan, GDP growth and federal tax revenue -- it will soar. Ironically, Washington will have more money to waste.Then, of course, the destroy Trump media -- they don't care about any of this. They're not interested in the truth. They're not interested in the business of offering solutions to people that have been left behind.What is the media's main objective? They create false narratives, outright lies. And their obvious goal is to try and damage, delegitimize President Trump. So instead of talking about his tax plan, his new reforms, the media is hysterical, it's, like, 24/7 hyperventilating about President Trump and his decision to be constitutional on the issue of DACA, and give Congress an additional six months to do their job, come up with a law-abiding constitutional solution.Just take a look at how insane, how obsessed the media is in attacking the president and the attorney general.DON LEMON, CNN: It's so obvious. It's not even dog whistle anymore. It's just flat out bias, flat out discrimination that they're touting coming from this White House.UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: Increasingly, there's a sign out there that's been hung up in the White House or outside the White House saying, If you're not white, you're not especially welcome. And that just -- that -- that is so sad.MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: Is this a stability issue? Because I feel like some might argue, when you see him off prompter, he doesn't really seem to be there.JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: What do you mean by that?BRZEZINSKI: Doesn't really connect with the reality of the situation.SCARBOROUGH: I don't think he really understood his decision. And I'm not being facetious. There are people inside the White House that were saying that he really didn't understand the impact of his decision.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC: For years, he has been an outspoken, unabashed admirer of the eugenics-based race-specific immigration bans of the 1920s Klan era in U.S. politics.I mean, Jeff Sessions has always stood for this stuff, but so has Donald Trump as a public political figure.HANNITY: More lies. But that was not the end of the media's hysteria. They also tried to spin the president's decision to respect the Constitution, respect coequal branches of government, the real balance of power. They tried to portray this -- watch (ph) the world of the day was cruel, cruel, and then cruel again. Take a look.UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: Today's actions by the president and Jeff Sessions is nothing short than cruel, as well as compassion-less.UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: And we're just going to go and cruelly just take them away from this life?VAN JONES, CNN: Trump could just tell Congress to do it without terrifying and scaring the bejeebers out of all these kids. In other words, there's a cruelty there.FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN: This is a signal. And it's a signal to say, I can do something that a lot of people think is cruel.SYMONE SANDERS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, ON CNN: This -- so one, this was a cruel, inhumane and unnecessary move that the Trump administration did today.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, TODAY/NBC: His critics say the decision was cruel.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, TODAY/NBC: Immigration advocates say the move to cut them off is cruel.JARED BERNSTEIN, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, ON CNN: If you guys could zoom in on the Statue of Liberty right now, I suspect she'd be shedding a tear. This is a dark day for our country.HANNITY: Oh, they got the memo! Cruel, cruel, cruel. Notice they're like robots in the mainstream media.Now, I got to tell you something. The president has already given Congress eight months. Now they have six additional months. If you want DACA, go ask your congressmen and senators.Now, what the media has been trying to do to President Trump -- they've been doing this for months. They are creating lies and a false narrative. And again, they want to smear this president in order to try and scare the American people into turning against him. They peddle nonsense, lies 24/7.And what the president actually did, instead of stomping on the Constitution, shredding the rule of law -- by the way, even Obama recognized he didn't have the right to do it. He said it, like, 20 times. Well, President Trump is giving Congress now an additional six months to do their job, legislate, and come up with a solution.Now, apparently, members of the elite establishment media -- they need to go back to school and maybe take a class on how the government works because it actually takes Congress. They make the laws. We have three branches of government. And the president -- guess what? He signs the laws. There are limits to executive authority and power. Obama said it himself.The media seems so absolutely apoplectic to just go after everything Trump. So let's have Barack Obama himself give them a lesson. Here's the former president over the years, well, before he signed DACA and after he signed DACA, talking about his own limits of executive power. Media, watch, listen, learn. Is this cruel?THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SEN. BARACK OBAMA, D-ILL., SEPT. 8, 2008: ... mock the Constitution? Don't make fun of it! Don't suggest that it's un-American to abide by what the Founding Fathers set up! It's worked pretty well for over 200 years!THEN-PRESIDENT OBAMA, MAY 10, 2011: Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works.OBAMA, MARCH 28, 2011: The notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order -- that's just not the case.OBAMA, JULY 25, 2011: Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. But that's not how -- that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.OBAMA, FEB. 4, 2013: The problem is, is that, you know, I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.OBAMA, FEB. 2, 2013: If we start broadening that, then, essentially, I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option.OBAMA, NOV. 25, 2013: If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we are also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition.HANNITY: Oh, Nation of laws. That's not how our Constitution works. And then he did it anyway. Wow. And here's what now Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told me back in 2014 about fighting President Obama's illegal, unconstitutional executive order on DACA. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, OCT. 28, 2014)HANNITY: If the president follows through on his threat for executive amnesty, what do you have in terms of tools at your disposal to stop him from doing that?REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS.: Well, first of all, it's unconstitutional. So we're already going through the court system on other unconstitutional executive orders that he has worked on it, and we would add this to the pile.HANNITY: So the president is respecting coequal branches of government and enumerated powers. He is literally restoring, right before your very eyes, the way the founders intended this to be.",
"SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to Hannity. My monologue will be coming up in our next segment. Also, Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business Network is here with a preview of her exclusive interview with President Trump.But first, we have a lot of news breaking all over the world tonight, so we begin with the Hannity news whip. Joining us first with more on Secretary Rex Tillerson's trip to Russia is Rich Edson. He's in Moscow tonight -- Rich.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good evening, Sean. In about 12 hours, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Secretary Tillerson says he has a choice for the Russian government, join the United States, the West and Middle Eastern countries to find a way to transition Syria from Bashar al Assad, the president, to a democracy, or Russia can continue to support Assad, Iran and Hezbollah.Tillerson also offered his strongest declaration thus far on the future of Bashar al Assad.REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think that it's clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important.EDSON: International efforts on that front have languished for years.Only a couple of hours before the secretary of state landed here in Moscow, Russian president Vladimir Putin addressed the country. He denied Assad used chemical weapons, says he wants the United Nations to launch an investigation into last week's attack, the attack that prompted that U.S. response, last Thursday and says that he believes Russian intelligence shows that Assad was essentially framed in that effort.Now, whether he says that directly to the secretary of state tomorrow is still up for question as the Kremlin has been saying there is no official meeting yet scheduled between Secretary Tillerson and the Russian president -- Sean.HANNITY: All right, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it, Rich. Thank you.Joining us now from Turkey with more on the situation with Syria is our own Benjamin Hall. Benjamin, what's the latest there?BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sean, yesterday, the U.S. said that if the Assad regime used more chemical weapons or dropped barrel bombs that that could cause more U.S. strikes on Syria. Well, guess what? That's exactly what they did today, the Assad regime dropping barrel bombs on Hama province. These are weapons decided to kill, barrels filled with explosives, shrapnel, oil and nails dropped on town squares and hospitals. They are devastating. They have killed tens of thousands of people. And if Assad wanted to find a better way of antagonizing the U.S. on this day, he couldn't have found one.Also today here, we spoke to members of the Free Syrian Army backed by the U.S. at a safe house in Turkey. We spoke to some who actually came from the town that was bombed with the chemicals, Khan Sheikhoun, they said that the attacks there had actually galvanized the people. Have a listen.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Life there is desperate now and people are said. But the attack has made us even more determined to fight the regime and protect our town. But we need more help.HALL: And by help, he says a no-fly zone over the skies and anti-aircraft weapons, which of course, the U.S. has said categorically they will not give to the rebels -- Sean.HANNITY: All right, Benjamin, thank you.And earlier today, our own Maria Bartiromo sat down with President Trump in an interview. It will air in its entirety tomorrow on the Fox Business Network. Here's a quick preview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MORNINGS WITH MARIA/FBN)MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: When you were with the president of China, you're launching these military strikes.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes.BARTIROMO: Was that planned? How did that come about that it's happening right then because right there, you're saying, a reminder, here's who the superpower in the world is?TRUMP: You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this. I have had -- I have watched speculation for three days now what that was like.BARTIROMO: When did you tell him?TRUMP: I'll tell you.BARTIROMO: Before dessert, or...TRUMP: I will tell you. I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. We're now having dessert. And We had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen. And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded. What do you do? And we made a determination to do it. So the missiles were on the way.HANNITY: And joining me now, the host of Mornings With Maria, our friend, Maria Bartiromo. Congratulations on a big exclusive.Let's start with what the president told you about Syrian president Assad and how he had to do something after being really motivated by seeing those pictures of dead children, victims of that chemical attack. Here's what happened.TRUMP: Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person. And I think it's a very bad for Russia. I think it's a very bad for mankind. It's very bad for this world. But when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs -- they have these massive barrels with dynamite, and they drop them right in the middle of a group of people -- and in all fairness, you see the same kids, no arms, legs, no face. This is an animal.I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures, especially when you see them on television, and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms or you see kids gasping for life and you know it's over -- it's over for them. They're hosing them down -- hundreds of them -- when you see that -- I immediately called General Mattis. I said, What can we do? And they came back with a number of different alternatives. And we hit them very hard.Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that -- I mean, even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gases that they used. And some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So when I saw that, I said we have to do something.HANNITY: All right, Maria, obviously the president was very emotionally moved by those images. But also, if you paid close attention to his campaign rhetoric, he wants to fight terror, he doesn't want occupation and he didn't want troops on the ground. He seemed to reiterate all of that to you in that interview.Give us some more background and color as to what he was also saying.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, president Trump knows exactly who the evil actors are in the world. I was very impressed in terms of his knowledge of what's happening in that part of the world and who is behind it.Look, the truth is, is that many generals, and you know, military people out there know that former secretary John Kerry did advocate doing something, limited military action in Syria. But President Obama time and time again rejected it. He did not want to do any military strike in Syria.President Trump saw those pictures, saw what was really happening on the ground and moved. And that's why he had broad support all around the world for those moves.I will say this. The sound bite that you just ran, when he said, Look, this is an evil man and Russia is backing an evil person -- that was in response to my question to the president asking him if, in fact, our relationship, the U.S. relations with Russia has been damaged by this move. He said, I don't know. But I will say this, this is an evil man and Russia is backing an evil person.So I would say to you, as Rex Tillerson meets with Mr. Lavrov tomorrow in Russia, he has more leverage. He goes into that meeting with more leverage because the world agrees with President Trump in terms of what he just did.He made it very clear he does not want to get in some long-term entanglement in Syria. Having said that, he is going to take an action, make a move when he sees this done on humanity. So that's where he stands. He would not commit to, you know, what happens next. And we know that because he's never going to tell you exactly where -- what he's thinking and -- and -- and you know, put the plans out there on the table.But he definitely felt strongly in terms of this was something that he needed to act, the U.S. needed to be up front on.HANNITY: You know, it's fascinating. For eight months, we've had this media conspiracy theory being pushed and advanced without any evidence whatsoever...BARTIROMO: Right.HANNITY: ... of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and that perhaps that Vladimir Putin had information that would be compromising to then candidate, then President-elect Trump. Now he's president, and he kind of drew a really strong line in the sand that should put that to rest.Let me ask you -- because, of course, we have more saber rattling from Kim Jong-un, North Korea, and even the threat that he would want to nuke the United States of America and is preparing for war with the United States -- you asked him about that. Let's play that clip.BARTIROMO: You redirected Navy ships to go toward the Korean peninsula. What are we doing right now in terms of North Korea?"]

The homeland of the enterprising and brave Pashtuns, from the borders of the Punjab to parts of Balochistan and south-southeastern Afghanistan, is divided by the powerful destiny-shaping Durand line.Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of imperial India, who in 1893 drew a line over the Hindu Kush and the western Himalayas as the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman, consented. The line is one of the lasting imperial legacies of South Asia. Since then, this invisible yet powerful cartographical reality has defined the westernmost frontier of undivided India and formed the core of the Afghanistan-Pakistan territorial issues.Rajiv Dogra, former diplomat and an expert on Pakistan and Afghanistan, has written a comprehensive account of the origin, problems of the Durand Line and indicates the way ahead. The impact of the Durand Line is best summed by the comment from Wali Khan that Dogra has recounted. When asked about his identity, Wali Khan, son of legendary ‘Frontier Gandhi’, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, said, he was, “a six-thousand year-old Pashtun, a thousand-year-old Muslim and a twenty-seven year-old Pakistani.”In one sweep, Dogra has covered the history of the negotiations of Durand to former U.S. President Barack Obama’s policies and the continued war on terror that rages across the Durand that Pakistan considers legitimate and Afghanistan wants to erase.The line has caused continued friction between Kabul and Islamabad. Though a multi-ethnic society, Afghanistan has been dominated by the Pashtuns and a long line of Pashtun leaders like President Babrak Karmal to President Hamid Karzai have advocated the cause of the Pashtun homeland that was separated by the line.The Durand Line was born as the outcome of a felt need to define the British frontier in South Asia.In the 21st century, given the continued violence in Afghanistan, the line has failed to consolidate the Pashtun identity as it has failed to secure a sense of homeland among the Pashtuns who continue to scatter around the world as a fallout of the post-9/11 world disorder.However, the Durand Line is not always a curse as it has contained Pakistan’s territorial identity though it also left the idea of a Pashtun/Pathan homeland unrealised.In a positive sense, the Durand Line also provides India with a reason to raise a red flag every time ‘cross border’ attacks are carried out by Pakistan-based elements against Afghanistan.Dogra has written a biography of a cartographical creation that was long awaited. The book is a must read")]
