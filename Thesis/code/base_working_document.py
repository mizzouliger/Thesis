raw_documents = ["SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Thanks, Tucker. And welcome to Hannity.And this is a Fox News alert. And tonight, we are following four, four major breaking news stories involving what is the biggest Russian scandal in the history of this country. The evidence is now incontrovertible. It is overwhelming that the Clintons sold out our National Security to the Russians and the Obama administration did nothing to stop them and then they covered it up.Democrats and the media, they have been lying to for over a year about what is really going on. Tonight, we have brand-new details as we continue to expose the truth that they won't even talk about.Also tonight, Ivanka Trump will join us for an exclusive interview. Also Newt Gingrich, that is coming up later.But first, NBC News reporting tonight the brother of former Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta is now under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller. We will also check in with John Sullivan from The Hill, a new explosive report about a Russian spy trying to gain access to Hillary and Bill back in 2009.Also, Congressman Ron DeSantis says, the House is now probing. Thanks to of course, Sara, John Solomon and this program, the Uranium One deal and the FBI informant who helped to expose this scandal can prove it and can show was a quid pro quo.Also, Hillary Clinton is lashing out at the President, Fox News and yours truly over the new revelations about Uranium One and her potentially criminal conduct. We are going to cover all of this. We have an important breaking news opening monologue.When it comes to Russia, we have been telling you for over a year that Democrats, their allies in the mainstream media, have been flat out lying to you, the American people, about what is really happening. Now, we've also been predicting that it would only be a matter of time before they manufactured hysteria, conspiracy theories when Russia blew up in their faces and that this entire thing is going to boomerang back on the Democrats and of course the media.Tonight, that continues to happen. And let me tell you why. NBC News is out with a bombshell report. Here's their own headline. Mueller is now investigating Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta -- name sound familiar? Now he happens to be the brother of Hillary Clinton's former campaign Chairman John Podesta. And according to NBC News, the special counsel Robert Mueller has launched a criminal inquiry into Tony Podesta and his lobbying firm, the Podesta group.As NBC is reporting, Mueller's investigation began by looking into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort but has since now expanded to include Tony Podesta over whether his firm violated what is known as FARA, the Foreign Agent Registration Act. Now under the law, lobbyists in the United States who worked for foreign entities, they must register with the Department of Justice and disclose what they are doing. And according to NBC, well, the Podesta group lobbied for a Ukrainian nonprofit called the European Center for a modern Ukraine that has ties to pro-Russia political parties in that country.Now, this is where it gets interesting. As NBC News reports, the Podesta group updated that registration and -- about his work with the Ukrainian group only in June, only after media reports, only after Congress started asking questions.This hypocrisy from the Democrats is beyond stunning. Now, we have heard from over a year now, Russia is a hostile country, Putin is a such a bad character. And now it's the Democrats? What do you hear from the media, the corrupt media? Crickets. Nothing. Hillary Clinton, members of her campaign, they've been attacking President Trump and claiming there's a Trump Russia conspiracy collusion despite zero evidence for over a year while John Podesta's brother -- that's right -- John Podesta's brother, the guy that ran Hillary's campaign, may have broken the law.Also tonight, John Solomon is out with another explosive report about Hillary Clinton. Take a look at this headline. FBI watched, and then acted as Russian spy moved closer to Hillary Clinton. Remember the media's reaction to Paul Manafort and Don, Jr.?Now according to The Hill, the FBI has evidence that when Hillary Clinton first became the secretary of state, this is in 2009, Vladimir Putin in the Russians, they launched a campaign to try to gain access to Hillary, her top aides, her husband, Bill Clinton.And according to The Hill, one attempt included a female Russian pretending to be an American accountant. Now, that spy used a false identity to secure a job with the major Democratic donor in the hopes that she would be able to collect intelligence on Hillary Clinton and the State Department. Well, guess what, that Russian agent was eventually arrested and deported as part of the FBI's massive 2010 spy ring bust.Now, according to an email that The Hill obtained, the Democratic donor who may have been compromised actually contacted the State Department to alert Hillary Clinton about what was happening. Now, we did reach out to that donor for comment and we did not hear back. Shocking.Now, a Hillary Clinton spokesperson significantly tries as always to downplay this story, responding to The Hill this weekend, claiming, oh, it's all part of a partisan distraction. In other words, the vast right-wing conspiracy. Not surprising. But think about this for a second. At the exact same time, Vladimir Putin and Russia are trying to infiltrate Clinton's inner circle, Hillary is using a private server that had top-secret special access programs, classified national security information on it. The mom and pop shop bathroom. The same server that was less secure than your average Gmail account.Clinton knew what was happening because her office commented on the Russia spy ring bust back in 2010. Yet, she continued to use the personal server. Now that's beyond reckless. And it's a direct threat to national security.But that's only part of it. If that's not shocking enough, we have John Solomon and Sara Carter's reporting from last week. Here are the highlights from last week: Bill Clinton, he tried to get the State Department to give him permission to meet with Russian nuclear officials while the Uranium One deal was being approved by the Obama administration and his own wife. An American lobbying firm took millions of dollars from a Russian state run nuclear energy corporation while at the same time providing pro bono services -free services -- to the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Foundation.Now back in 2009 -- now, the FBI was doing their job. They discovered evidence including documents and emails and financial records. They had eyewitness accounts that the Russian nuclear officials working on behalf of Vladimir Putin and Russia and Moscow, they were engaging in bribery. Kickbacks, money laundering, extortion and various other types of racketeering. And by the way, other criminal conduct.Now, just before the deal -- Bill gets $500,000 when speaking in Moscow. That's twice his normal speaking fee. He got it from a bank that had an interest in the Uranium One deal. Well, Bill, he tried to meet while he was in Russia with nuclear leaders. He had to ask his own wife's State Department for permission, but instead he did not meet with them, he met directly with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government that has ties to the bank, that is paying Bill Clinton and has an interest in Uranium One. Why?Because Vladimir Putin, he wanted control over America's uranium market. And what is so inexcusable is that the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, so many others, they let this happen.And in 2010, the Uranium One deal, it was approved. It gave Vladimir Putin what he wanted. Control of 20 percent of America's uranium supply. The foundational material for nuclear weapons. Who would ever do this?And we also learned from The Hill and CircaNews.com, the FBI has evidence including testimony -- they have an informant -- that Russia nuclear officials funneled millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was serving as secretary of state and personally signing off on the Uranium One deal in the first place, that gave the uranium to Putin. And it turns out, the informant was blocked by the Obama administration from exposing to Congress what was happening.Now The New York Times also reported back in 2015 that the Russian nuclear company Uranium One was actually even exporting yellowcake uranium outside of our country to Canada. Now, even though they did not have a license. So, we have no idea what Putin has done with it, where it's ended up. Did he go to North Korea? Did he go to Iran?There is also several key officials that need to testify about what they knew and when they knew it. For example, the former Attorney General Eric Holder, he oversaw the FBI. The FBI had all of this information about bribery and kickbacks and money laundering in 2009. That was his job. He was also a member -- Eric Holder was -- of the committee that approved Uranium One along with Hillary. So, he had to know what was going on.And then you've heard the name Rod Rosenstein, he appointed Mueller's the special counsel looking into Trump-Russia collusion, he is the deputy attorney general now. He actually helped lead the FBI investigation into the Russian bribery scandal.And we have the special counsel himself, Robert Mueller. Well, back in 2009, he was the FBI director during this entire scandal. And now we are supposed to trust Mueller is going to investigate Russian interference fairly, objectively and honestly when he didn't tell Congress about the Russian bribery plot and crimes that the FBI said they knew were being committed?This is inexcusable. There is also another reason Mueller needs to go and he needs to go immediately. There is also the fact that Robert Mueller has a troubling track record as a federal prosecutor. Take a look at this headline from FoxNews.com. Quote, Mueller team criticized by fellow attorneys for history of questionable tactics.Now a criminal defense attorney is saying that Mueller tried to entrap him while the now special counsel was working as a prosecutor in Boston. The same attorney also warned of Mueller's Russian probe, well, should be met with skepticism.And tonight, Congressman Ron DeSantis says the House Oversight Committee is now investigating this Uranium One deal. Congressman DeSantis also revealed some stunning information about the FBI informant.Let's take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: I've been able to speak with the confidential informant that helped the FBI uncovered this bribery scheme. I've spoken with his attorney. And this informant wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement that was signed with the Eric Holder Justice Department. He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta Lynch Justice Department.We have the money that went to Bill Clinton for the speech, the half a million dollars, millions of dollars to the foundation from sources connected with Uranium One. And then you have the approval of the deal on the CFIUS board which Hillary Clinton was a member of in 2010. So, we do have the quid, we have the quo. This informant I believe would be able to link those two together because he was right at the heart of a lot of what was going on at the time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You see what is happening? Since we've been covering this -- because John Solomon, Sara Carter have done amazing investigative work. Maybe -- and we've been covering it on this show. Now Congress is getting it. Now, think about this: maybe what Ron DeSantis was saying, maybe that's the reason why the Obama administration blocked this FBI informant from talking. Because he might be able to expose the criminal conduct from the Clintons and others within the Obama administration.Now whatever nondisclosure agreement this informant apparently signed with the Obama Department of Justice, it needs to be ripped up and it can be ripped up by the Trump administration, by the Justice Department. You, the American people, deserve to know the truth about the Clintons and how they sold out your national security.And finally tonight, in just a pathetic display, and despite mountains of evidence and two Congressional investigations, Hillary Clinton is saying, oh, she did nothing wrong during the Uranium One deal. And Clinton is also attacking President Trump, Fox News and yes, even yours truly. Because we are telling you the truth. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, C-SPAN 2)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sean Hannity on his program has been very critical of the Uranium One deal, the president saying with regard to Russia, that is the real story in all of this. What would you say to those critics?HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: I would say, it's the same baloney they've been peddling for years. And there is been no credible evidence by anyone.Trump and his allies including Fox News are really expert at distraction and diversion. So, the closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians, as we heard Jeff Sessions finally admit to in his testimony the other day, the more they want to just throw mud on the wall and I am their favorite target, me and, you know, President Obama, we're the ones that they always like to put into the cross hairs.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The vast right wing conspiracy is back. Hillary, I have a few questions for you. Why would you ever give Vladimir Putin, the man you've been telling us is so horrible and Russia -- of course our biggest enemy -- why would you give them 20 percent of America's uranium? The foundational material for nuclear weapons? Why would you ever do that? Why did your husband get twice the amount of money that he usually gets from a speech in Moscow and at the time of the deal, he meets with Vladimir?And by the way, I have another question: Hillary Clinton, why did you take 145 plus million dollars from all the people associated with this deal? And will you go under oath and answer questions? I doubt it. You don't want to, do you?All right. Joining us now with reaction, President Trump's attorney from The American Center for Law and Justice, their chief counsel, Jay Sekulow. From The Hill, John Solomon, he's been breaking a lot of these stories. And from Circa News, Sara Carter. John, we'll start with you.Let's start with Hillary's comments first. What do you thought? She is now packed to the vast right wing conspiracy.JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: Well, it was a non-denial at the end of the day. Right? And we've seen this many times before. We've seen denials that Hillary Clinton made that turned out not to be true. I didn't send classified information about my email. She did, didn't she? Back in 2010, her staff said that she hadn't been the target of this Russian spy ring. We now know from the counterintelligence chief of the FBI she was the target and she got an email from the donor warning her that this story was coming out. So, I think we have to take everything she says with a grain of salt, follow the evidence, follow the money and we will get the real truth at some point.HANNITY: If we follow the evidence, follow the money, Jay Sekulow, from a legal perspective, put your ACLJ hat on. Not your counsel to the President hat on.SOLOMON: Yes. What vulnerabilities are here? I see many.JAY SEKULOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Well, there's a lot. But one of the questions you've got to ask is, there was an agency that was charged with determining whether the sale could take place. That is the committee on foreign investments in the United States. Did they know about this investigation going on by the FBI? Did they know about this firing before they have proved this?Because at the end of the day, the real question here, is why in the world we're selling or allowing to be sold 20 percent of our uranium reserves in the United States to a company that was going to ultimately be controlled by the Russian or Russian government? So, that's the question you ask yourself. Where was these agencies that had to sign off on all this?HANNITY: Wait a minute, Eric Holder, wait a minute, Jay, Eric Holder had to know.SEKULOW: Yes.HANNITY: The head of the FBI. Robert Mueller had to know. Because they are saying the FBI knew of crimes, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, money laundering, these are not small things that they had evidence on.SEKULOW: Right. So, what happens in a situation like this, the Department of Justice represented which was Eric Holder, the attorney general, should have known -- had to have known about the investigation. Now, the FBI head was not on this committee. What I want to know, what I think the American people has the right to know is, what was this committee told before they authorized the sale to the Russian company? That is the critical aspect of this, legally.HANNITY: Sara, they had to know. Now, we have a Senate investigation. We have a House investigation. Jeff Sessions wouldn't say directly because of the policy, the Department of Justice but I assume he is investigating this. And now we also have the whole issue of this -- we have a witness. We have a source. We have somebody that wants to tell the whole story with documents, with evidence, with facts. And I'm told even recordings but he signed this NDA. Who makes a guy that worked for the FBI signed the NDA?SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: The FBI and the Justice Department. So, when he first began to work for him, they asked him to sign this nondisclosure agreement. Remember Sean, this case started out as counterintelligence case. So, it evolved into a criminal case according to my sources. So, there are a lot of issues here both classified and some that are unclassified. The classified issues he will have to speak to the Senate or an Intelligence Committee behind closed doors in order to reveal what he knows.HANNITY: Wait a minute. Who can lift the nondisclosure agreement that the guy that has the evidence, that knew the laws were broken, at the time, they knew this in 2009 and 2010. That was John's report today. That's what you've been telling us.SEKULOW: The attorney general. The attorney general had that authority.SOLOMON: That is right.HANNITY: Well, then Jay, let me go back to your legal hat for a second. So, the attorney general has an obligation now. If you look at the entire year that we have heard Russia, Russia, Russia and that Putin is such a bad character and this is an enemy country of the United States -- if you had people, nine of them signing off at a time they know that Vladimir Putin is trying to corner the market in this country on uranium, money doubled up speaking fees that Clinton gets.SEKULOW: Yes.HANNITY: And then the Clinton Foundation money gets $145 million after. They are signing off, Bill Clinton is meeting Vladimir, he wants to meet with nuclear officials in Russia. And I'm sorry, it seems that a lot of crimes are committed here. So, go ahead.SEKULOW: Well, you can act about the fact that the spies that were deported from the United States were not charged until four years later. So, again, it goes back to that fundamental issue of what did this committee know and again if you are the head of the Department of Justice, the attorney general of the United States, you had to know what was going on here. But the Attorney General Jeff Sessions had the legal authority to remove the NDA and --HANNITY: He needs to do this tomorrow.SEKULOW: Yes. But the classified information would of course be behind, you know, in protection and behind closed doors. But the other information, look, I think the American people have not only the right to know, I think the government has the obligation to let the American people know how 20 percent of the uranium in the United States was sold to the Russians. That's a Russian scandal. You want to Russian scandal? There is one.HANNITY: Well, wait a minute because I have now compromised our national security. And isn't Vladimir Putin friends with the Iranian mullahs? Is he friends with Kim Jong Un? Who is he giving the yellowcake that he is illegally exporting to Canada in that particular point? All right. I want to ask this, what about the conflicts of interest Mueller? What about the conflicts of interest Rosenstein? What about the conflict of interest -- and others? John, we will start with you.SOLOMON: You know, I don't see a direct conflict of interest with any of those guys, their job is to go find the truth and if they do their job correctly, we're going to get the truth on this as we're going to get on all the different things on Russia. If they don't do their job, then people are going to say, where are they conflicted?Right now, I think there is an important question that has not been discussed. Things started in the counterintelligence world, they tend to go to the President and PDB (ph) and the briefing, to the intelligence chiefs long before they ever get to the criminal side. I think one of the questions we have to start asking is, what did the President know? Did any of this get brief to the President in the form on intelligence? He's meeting with Medvedev, with Putin. You think they would be telling these things?HANNITY: Yes.SOLOMON: That's one of the things I think we're going to learn a lot about the next few weeks.HANNITY: We've got to know an answer to that.SOLOMON: Yes, we do.HANNITY: And that would mean that former President Obama needs to be deposed. All right. Let me ask Sara and then I will ask John. You want to answer the conflict of interest question, Sara, but also I want to ask you this. How much more do you know is coming on this? Because, go ahead.CARTER: Oh, I certainly think that the informant has a lot to share with both Congress and the American people and I know that he felt it was his patriotic duty to come forward with this and to share this information.HANNITY: Have you and John spoke to the informant?CARTER: Yes, I have spoken to the informant through his attorney. Yes, I have.HANNITY: And John?SOLOMON: I can't say.HANNITY: You can't say.SOLOMON: Sorry.SEKULOW: They are protected by the First Amendment to not.SOLOMON: For me to be evasive but I just answered it.HANNITY: All right. You be quiet for a minute. I don't need that attorney stuff. You're ruining my show here.CARTER: Sean --HANNITY: All right. How much more is coming? Because to me, it sounds like, look, I've heard they have not only documents but emails, financial records, eyewitnesses, infiltration, are there tapes here?SOLOMON: There are. There are definitely.HANNITY: Wow!SOLOMON: Yes. At least one videotape into audio recordings that potentially will be available to the public at some point.HANNITY: Jay, if they come out, if people don't get indicted here, we don't have equal justice under the law, do we?SEKULOW: No, you are right. And I'll tell you what John said, I would sure like to know what President Obama was briefed on with regards to this whole transaction as well. Because again, this was the sale of a U.S. reserve of uranium. I mean, it was Canadian company first and then we authorize the sale to the Russians. It does not pass the smell test. And I'll tell you what, legally, very questionable. Potentially illegal. I think it would question the illegality here. But I'll tell you something else, Sean, the American people have a right to know what happened.HANNITY: And all of you, and John, and Sara, you guys made this happen. And we are going to get to the truth. And all of you in the media, you are awful.When we comeback, Newt Gingrich, Ivanka Trump, all here, busy news night tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to Hannity. Here with reaction to our opening monologue and the new developments in this massive corruption, Uranium One scandal. The author of, now the bestselling book, Vengeance. Former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, you know, I know the Clintons have gotten away with an awful lot in their career.Twenty percent of the foundational material for nuclear weapons. The media has ignored this.Meanwhile, they've had no evidence, Russia, Russia, Russia. The danger of Vladimir Putin, the danger of Russia. What do you make of all of this?NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think we are on the edge of the greatest corruption scandal in American history. Bigger than the scandal in the 1920s, about the Teapot Dome, bigger than Grant's presidency in the 1870s. I don't know of any occasion that had the scale of scandal this day. And you see it building. You watch Mueller who I've been very critical of.But to his credit, he is now following the Podesta family into their relation with foreigners. He is beginning to follow other cases that are very different. I mean, you know, the great irony here, Sean maybe, that the one person who comes out of this totally exonerated as Donald J. Trump and that the people who did all the attacking, you have to ask yourself, think back to this, you are Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. It's election night. You lost. You are john Podesta.You know that Podesta associates had been doing work for the Russians and the Ukrainians. How do you have the chutzpah to decide that it's the Russians who elected Trump? I mean, why did they have no sense of vulnerability that once they open this, it was just going to get sicker and sicker. And I'll tell you, just mark this for tonight, the breaking point will come when the Congress has the courage to demand that every donation to the Clinton Foundation be published and we learn how tremendous the level of foreign influence buying was and how unbelievable it was and what a threat that is to the American democracy.HANNITY: It seems that there could be no longer -- now, finally the House and finally the Senate and I'm kind of assuming and interpreting from the Attorney General's comments that an investigation is here. But I think you are right in this sense, I think this is way beyond Trump-Russia collusion. And I don't like investigative creep, I've been very clear about it. I know that now it's about Paul Manafort's financial dealings from long before he was with Trump and the Podesta group. But I can think of a single circumstance ever -- ever -- to give 20 percent of uranium.Now that we follow the money and now that we see Bill gets double his speaking fee and he wanted to meet with nuclear officials and he met with Putin and in his speech supported the Uranium One deal and his wife had to sign off on this. And then all the Canadians that were involved in the deal kicked back $145 million to the foundation. I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, this is a sellout, of American national security.GINGRICH: Oh, yes.HANNITY: At the highest level.GINGRICH: Yes. Look, everything the average American is believed about corruption in Washington is about to be validated. Allen Guelzo who was a great historian at Gettysburg College wrote me recently that by the time this is all out, every other presidential scandal in American history will look trivial, that this is the most corrupt, the most unbelievably unlawful administration in American. The Clintons are only a part of this.Wait until you get to Attorney General Lynch. Wait until you get to her predecessor. Wait until you get to Samantha Powers at the U.N. This is going to keep on rolling and I think we will look back a year or two from now. We are going to be stunned at the dishonesty and bankruptcy of the Obama administration. Of which the, if you will that the apex is the Clinton team and I have a very simple challenge for the Congress. Get all of their donations on the record. When you go to the Canadian Clinton foundation, which did not have to report, very clever legal gimmick, but wrong. You start taking these apart. It's horrendous.HANNITY: Follow that and also lift the NDA. Apparently there are tapes. There are emails. Let me go through the mountain of evidence they have. The FBI had in 2009 documents, emails, they had the financial records. They have eyewitnesses and they had someone infiltrate. And they knew crimes are being committed. They knew then. That raises questions about Mueller too. I've got a break. Stay right there. We will stay with you. When we come back, we have the other issues in Washington. More NFL players just continuing to disrespect the flag. Guess what happened? The crowds are getting smaller and smaller and smaller. Ivanka Trump joins a straight ahead on the dizzy breaking news night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to Hannity. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, he soundly alarm of the impact player protesting having in the NFL said quote, there is no question the league is suffering negative effects from this protest. Jerry Jones is right. Take a look. This is only two stadiums this weekend. One from Miami and I think the other is from Cleveland. Look at all the empty seats. Post kickoff. Look at this. It's empty. Here's what it looked like in Cleveland, Ohio, for the Browns yesterday. We will continue now Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, do they want to keep doing this? This is the result of Roger Goodell does not want to take a stand. This is the results. I am not watching NFL games. I'm watching college football now. And I think most Americans are waiting for the NFL to stand up for those that fought, bled, and died under that flag. It's that simple.GINGRICH: I think you are exactly right. I think what multimillionaire players who are out there posturing don't understand is that most of us watch the game to watch football. We don't watch it watch political protest, to watch their personal idiosyncrasies and frankly, they ain't that big a deal in the long run. I think this has been devastatingly negative for the NFL. I think the absences of leadership of Roger Goodell is astonishing. I think the owners are about to decide their pocketbook as being hurt and then they will talk to Goodell, but it's really sad. Why should it be so, just take the last few weeks? Four young Americans die in Niger, hunting down and killing Islamic terrorists. Why should it be so hard to recognize and acknowledge their sacrifice by standing up during the national anthem? I mean, what is this sickness which is permeating our culture, which leads people to believe that they have the right to disrespect their flag, their pledge, their anthem, the veterans, and the people who keep them free and safe. There's something sick about what's happening in part of our culture. We need to have the guts to confront it head on.HANNITY: I want to play for you Maxine Waters. When I play this comment, I want you to think about it through the prism. Why are you looking at me? Why are you laughing? You know how to laugh my questions. I have known you for 30 years.GINGRICH: I'm not mocking you, Sean. I'm thinking about Maxine Waters.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: By the way. Regaining my time or whatever you said, reclaiming my time. This is her saying she is going to take out the President. If somebody said this about President Obama, think about this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: I am sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, and thinking about Ali, even though I never met him. With this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight.(APPLAUSE)(CHEERS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What's your reaction?GINGRICH: First of all, I am guessing her reference to Muhammad Ali is a reference to boxing. She meant it in the sense of hitting in the ring. He'd never get it to happen, but the idea of a round between her and Donald Trump is pretty interesting. I think he would probably win in the opening half minute. What you have on the left --HANNITY: He is not going to hit a girl. A woman. He is not going to do that.(LAUGHTER)GINGRICH: If he was confronted with her, she would be very pleasant until she hit him in to back and the second she had him coming she would be knocked down. Let us be honest here. This is crazy.HANNITY: Newt Gingrich encourages Trump to hit congresswoman. I can see the headlines now. That is not what you're saying.GINGRICH: My point is this, the left, I did this interview with the reporter the other day. I cut him off and I said you have a pathology. I can't answer your question because you are pathological. He was totally stunned and said what you mean? I said, you are so anti-Trump, you are not in touch with the real world so how can I interview with you? I think Maxine Waters is the same group. So crazy. Certified play out of touch with reality.HANNITY: Are you confident that the senate now will get this tax reform bill done? Because if they don't, they will.GINGRICH: I've got to tell you, I am waiting with baited breath for our good friend Mark Meadows and the freedom caucus and others to come together, because he indicated they will. If the house passes this budget this week and President Trump had it exactly right, if they pass this budget this week and we can move onto, first of all, the ways and means committee marking up with bill, spending it to the senate, which I think they will do. I think we've got a real shot of doing this. You know, you and I had been on this the whole time for nine months. This is a big deal, I think, I'm a little more optimistic tonight.HANNITY: They better get it done. Mr. Speaker, congrats on the success of the book. When we come back, speaking of that, we will talk to Ivanka Trump, next. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HAYES: Welcome back to Hannity. Earlier today, the first daughter and advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, she host today a town hall on tax reform on Pennsylvania. We need money back. I sat down with Ivanka Trump to discuss how the administration plans to move the tax proposal forward and pass it. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO)HANNITY: Joining us now, Ivanka Trump. Good to see you. How are you?IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: I'm doing great.HANNITY: I walk in the door and you start making fun of me. That is a great way to start an interview.(LAUGHTER)I. TRUMP: You know somebody's got to do it.HANNITY: Somebody's got to do it. You have an assistant or somebody that works for you in P.R., you can tell everybody. It's fine.I. TRUMP: You tried to set her up. And almost successful. What really excited me about this story was when I found out there was an actual web site where you're making matches. This is Jared and my secret talent. People don't realize it's our hidden skill. We are matchmakers.HANNITY: You like to put people together.I. TRUMP: Seven marriages, zero divorces. God willing that continues. Seven matches. I was feeling really good about myself. I was excited to tell you that statistic. You literally have hundreds. With babies are being born.HANNITY: I don't know why. I used to do these long book signings. They would go on for hours. A cute couple would come up and they would say they've been dating for three years and I would say what are you waiting for? And next thing you know, the girls going like this and the guys going like this. And I said do it right now. And I get the crowd to say, and a lot of guys would do it so.I. TRUMP: Oh, my god. You and Jared. Jared always pushing people. You have all the facts to continue to know. Make the move, make the move.HANNITY: a lot of people appreciate it and they did get married. I even have a child named after me. And dogs. More dogs and children named after me. Probably a better name for a dog.I. TRUMP: That is very funny.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: It is almost a year since your dad won and you've got involved on a lot of issues, but what you really focus in now is what I think this election is about and that is the forgotten men and women and that is why this tax reform bill is probably his biggest and most important piece of legislation to bring about the economic success that he was running on.I. TRUMP: Look. I feel so privileged to have the opportunity to serve our country. Nothing about my life was designed to pick up and move to Washington, but I feel really blessed that he entrusted in me and empowered me to do this. Ultimately, it's about the amazing people of this country that I met. Over two years of campaigning. The hardships I have witnessed. The opportunity to remove barriers so that more people can experience some of the privileges that my family and I were so lucky to have. This country give us everything. It afforded us so many incredible opportunities. And my mission now, through job creation and economic growth, it's to empower as many Americans as I possibly can. To realize the same opportunities. And this administration is doing it. We're doing it legislatively.Tax reform is so critical. We are doing it administratively deregulation. It really fueling entrepreneurship in this country. We see it in terms of optimism and the stock market. We see it in terms of the conversations you have. I'm here today. In Bucks County, Pennsylvania. I will hear it and every conversation I had with the people through the course of the day. That is what fuels us and that is what we are fighting for.HANNITY: You did a very good job of getting rid of burdens with regulations. That something as a conservative talk about all the time. I put so much pressure on businesses. They can't just go out and do their job. After work with the EPA and then this other agency. Not that we should not take care of the environment. Of course we have to be good stewards of the environment.I. TRUMP: There's some good regulation, but it's gotten out of control.HANNITY: Way out of control.I. TRUMP: And things that somebody in Washington thought on principle would be a good idea. It would have unintended consequences for millions of people. There's a lot of bad regulation that didn't fulfill the stated goal even if the intent was pure. I think rolling back years, decades, of layer upon layer of regulation is freeing up business owners to invest in businesses. Invest on the people who work in their businesses. You see wage growth for the first time. I think tax reform is so core to our goal of fueling the economic growth in this country.We need to be contented of. We need the tax code that is reflective with the modern reality of what our workforce looks like. Supporting our working families, the majority of which are now al income. Which is why I am really excited about the realization of a large part of the administration working family agenda through tax reform, expansion of the time child tax credit. Eliminating the marriage penalty. There's so many critical elements that support our dual values of work and the family. We need to be competitive and ultimately, we need growth. This is the country that everyone wants to grow their business.HANNITY: It's amazing. Your dad rightly said with one percent GDP growth that is worth $2.5 trillion to the treasury. That is a lot of money. The last administration was the first one never to reach three percent GDP growth in a year. I want to go back to the issue you brought up. Very middle- class in America, dishwasher at 12. A busboy, waiter, bartender. House painter. Wallpaper hanger, tile layer, framer, roofer, I did it all.I. TRUMP: Amazing.HANNITY: Yes I know. It's a pretty good list. I look at the economic plan and I'm like ok, the manufacturing centers build here, because corporations and lower taxes, because we have less regulation, it is a better environment. The repatriation of trillions from multinationals that more than not bring a fact here because they will lose 40 or $0.50 on every dollar, and you make a 10 cents, dint spend a lot of money here.I. TRUMP: And that is a bipartisan issue. Everyone's been talking for years about all this money parked off our shores that wants to come back into this country and nobody's been able to do anything about it. This tax plan fixes that. And enables businesses to bring that money home to invest in their infrastructure and business right here and invest in their workers. To you point about being competitive, the reality is, it's a global market place now. We have to compete against other countries. We are not competitive. We have the highest corporate taxes of any country in the developed world. That is something that very much gets factored into our pricing, pretty much gets factored into wages. That is why they are stagnated over the past several decades. We just now are starting to see them rise. I think a big part of that is that the regulation we are talking about before.I believe with my heart and soul and my father does and this administration does, that no one can best the American worker. There is no group of people more innovative, more motivated, and more capable. There's got to be a level playing field. There's not a level playing field. We've got to level the playing field for the corporation, the small business who is spending $16 billion a year to comply with a cumbersome tax code. To the individual. I mean, the reality is the simplification of our tax code Democratize is it.HANNITY: It does.I. TRUMP: If you have a tax code the average person can't understand, I know I can't, you know 94 percent of Americans require professional help to fil their taxes, it will benefit the person with an army of accountants and army of lawyers who can help them find the loopholes and nuances.HANNITY: You can give the same factual information to three of the best accounting houses in America and they will come up with different tax liabilities. That is how complicated it is. They aren't cheating.I. TRUMP: It's become thorough decades of lobbyists and special interest groups who added a nuance here, a page or idea here, part of the promise of this tax reform is cutting all of that out. Simplifying it. Democratizing it. Making it work for all Americans with a particular focus on middle income America. That is so important and what we are all fighting for.(END VIDEO)HANNITY: Tomorrow, part two with my interview with Ivanka Trump. She answers this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: It was interesting, Jimmy Carter even said he never witnessed any president taking as much heat as your dad. Also, the family. I mean you had been attack. Melania has been attack. Our little brother have been attacked. Don and Eric, I don't care about them.(LAUGHTER)They kind of deserve it.They can handle themselves. Certain unfairness.HANNITY: We give it out as well.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Part of it is personally and mean. How do you deal with that? Is that hard?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The answer to that question tomorrow night. More Hannity after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. Quick announcement before we go. My movie, Let There Be Light. It is an award-winning, I am the executive producer in theaters Friday about one man's journey to fate. Something the entire family will enjoy. Bring tissues. You will cry. And to check out the listing just go to hannity.com. We will have more later on this week.Unfortunately that is all the time we have left this evening. Let not your heart be troubled. We will never be the left Trump hating media, we will be fair and balance. Now I have good news, you know your friend Bill Hemmer? He is on tonight, live next. I saw him in his office. He's been studying all night. Hemmer is up next. We will be seeing you tomorrow night. It's time for Congress to quit lecturing the American people and get back to work. This is a rush transcript from  Hannity,  November 9, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Hey, Tucker. Thanks. Great show.", 
"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Thanks to you at home for joining us this hour.Woodrow Wilson was first elected president in 1912. When he ran for re-election in 1916, one of the animating issues of that campaign was WorldWar I, which was raging in Europe in which Wilson promised the UnitedStates would not join.In 1916, Wilson was reelected barely, but then in 1917, the U.S. declaredwar on Germany and threw itself into World War I, and by the time themidterm elections came around the year after that, in 1918, Wilson s notonly facing the typical headwinds that a president`s party usually faces inmidterm elections he was also just roundly detested for World War I and forother stuff too.And so, in those midterm elections in 1918, Woodrow Wilson`s party, theDemocratic Party, got walloped. Republicans took over control of theSenate and they took over control of the House. And the Republicans get inCongress that had far-reaching consequences in all sorts of ways.But in the House, it meant a gigantic and very, very consequentialpromotion for this man. His name is Albert Johnson. Such a generic name,right? It`s actually hard to Google. There was another congressman namedAlbert Johnson from a different state who had nothing to do with them.There was a federal judge was called Albert Johnson. There was a famousCanadian fugitive called the Mad Trapper of Rat River who was called AlbertJohnson.But this was Albert Johnson, a backbench congressman from Washington statewhose whole public profile had been built around the defense of the whiterace and the threat that non-white immigrants posed to white civilizationin the United States. Albert Johnson at home in Washington state, he ran arabble-rousing anti-immigrant newspaper called the home defender. Hebragged about having been part of mob violence that chased immigrants outof Washington state and out of the United States into Canada.And so, he had been a rabble-rouser and an orator on that pet issue fordecades, but he`s never really wielded power on the subject until WoodrowWilson got shellacked in the 1918 midterm elections, and Albert Johnson`sparty, the Republican Party, took over leadership of the Congress. Andthat is what made it possible for Albert Johnson to take real power. Hebecame chairman of the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization. It washis life`s dream to be in charge of something like that and he did what hecould with it.As soon as soon after he took over, the House of Representatives Committeeon Immigration and Naturalization hired themselves an expert eugenicsagent. Albert Johnson, the chairman, in addition to serving in Congress,he had become the president of the Eugenics Research Association ofAmerica. And once he was chairman of that committee, he brought on one ofthe officers from the Eugenics Research Association, this guy HarryLaughlin, to become an expert eugenics consultant to the immigrationcommittee in Congress. And together, these two eugenicists – they got towork.In 1922, Harry Laughlin created this chart. Look, science, it`s a chart.You can see diagonal there. That`s the watermark of Truman StateUniversity. They`ve preserved this document online as part of theirhistory of eugenics project.But this is a chart that Harry Laughlin created when he was the experteugenics agent for that congressional committee. What this chart purportsto show is the relative social inadequacy of various immigrant races in theUnited States.What counts is social inadequacy?Well, according to the chart, that includes feeble-mindedness, insanity,crime, epilepsy, tuberculosis, blindness, deafness, deformity anddependency. And then the chart ranks your likelihood of being any of thosethings or having any of those things based on your national origin.Eugenics is best understood and best remembered now as the pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo that the Nazis used to explain why they felt theneed to categorize and kill whole populations as part of this insanesupposedly defensive plan to preserve their fragile but still superiorAryan gene pool, right?Eugenics is I think most easily associated with that genocidal, murderous20th century movement. But eugenics wasn`t a Nazi invention. It wasn`tonly a foreign fascist fascination. In the 1920s, we really did have achief congressional eugenicist who was using taxpayer dollars to rank therelative feeble-mindedness of American immigrants on the basis of theirnational origin.Before Congressman Albert Johnson made Harry Laughlin the chief eugenicsconsultant for his congressional committee, Mr. Laughlin had made a namefor himself by promoting model compulsory sterilization laws around theUnited States. Laughlin wanted states to forcibly neuter people as if theywere animals, to improve the American gene pool and Laughlin was frustratedwith the inefficient way that some states were going about that. So, hewrote model legislation to try to standardize it, make it more aggressive,make it more widespread – sterilize more people against their will iftheir genes are up to it.So, Albert Johnson became chair of the committee in 1919. He hired thischief eugenicist for the committee in 1921. By 1922, they were publiclyranking the genetic failings of Americans by their national origin. And bytwo years after that, by 1924, they actually had achieved what they wereaiming at.By 1924, Wilson was gone. It was a new president, Calvin Coolidge, and hesigned an anti-immigration bill that was written by Albert Johnson. It wascalled the Johnston Reed Immigration Act of 1924. Johnson was the authorin the House. Reed was the author in the Senate.And it was a eugenics bill. It was a bill to protect America from a streamof alien blood. It was a bill to stop American civilization fromdescending into barbarism. That 1924 bill restricted immigrationdramatically.But also in a very specifically targeted way, it banned immigration fromAsian countries altogether. It defined an Asian exclusion zone from whichyou were not allowed to come to this country. It targeted Jews. Ittargeted Italians. It targeted other unworthy populations that tended tobe unpopular with the ascendant Klan at the time.And it did so through a kind of a neato (ph) math trick. The Johnson Reedanti-immigrant formula that they put into law in 1924. It limitedimmigrants based on national origin, but it did it in this very specificway. The numbers were based – the numbers of immigrants who would beallowed and now were based on the number of people of that national originwho had made it into this country by 1890.They went all the way back to 19th century to pick a date that they decidedwas white enough in American history to try to bring the country back to.So, they used the 1890 census as their benchmark to basically say, if yourpeople weren`t here in sufficient numbers by then, you can`t come now. Wewant the country to look like it did in 1890, not the way it`s getting alittle swarthier now.And, you know, you can look back on that now and see how radical it was. Imean, looking at it from almost any contemporaneous angle, but what is inarguable about that law is what`s clear in the contemporaneous record abouthow it was argued. It was nothing subtle about it. It was an explicitlyracist law, it was explicitly race-based in its intention there was nosecret about that.That was openly the way the legislation was talked about and argued about.The senator who wrote the bill with Albert Johnson, a Rhode Island senatornamed David Reed, he was quoted in The New York Times saying that thanksto that bill, quote, the racial composition of America at this time is thusmade permanent.Another senator named Ellison Durant Smith got up on the Senate floor tospell out why the Johnson-Reed 1924 immigration bill was getting his vote.He said, quote: It seems to me that the point of this measure is that thetime has arrived when we should shut the door. Thank God we have inAmerica perhaps the largest percentage of any country in the world of thepure unadulterated Anglo-Saxon stock. It is for the preservation of thatsplendid stock that has characterized us that I would make this not anasylum for the oppressed of all countries, but a country to assimilate andperfect that splendid type of manhood that has made America the foremostnation in her progress and in her power.I mean, it`s somewhere between embarrassing and painful, right, to thinkabout the fact that this is less than a hundred years ago, that the UnitedStates made an explicitly eugenicist overhaul of its immigration policy,right? To make America more white, to protect the white race from thesegenetically inferior hordes who are somehow going to threaten the geneticsuperiority and purity of white Americans, right?I mean, we can at least be thankful that the historical record on this isso clear, right? So there can be no mistaking that that`s what it`s about.Anybody looking at the immigration policy in this country and where we`vebeen has to know what that was all about. That really was eugenics.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)THEN-SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS (R), ALABAMA: In seven years, we`ll have thehighest percentage of Americans non-native born since the founding of therepublic. And some people think, well, we`ve always had these numbers butit`s not so. This is very unusual. It`s a radical change. And in factwhen the numbers reach about this high in 1924, the president and Congresschanged the policy, and it slowed down immigration significantly and wethen assimilated through the 1965, and created really the solid middleclass of America, with assimilated immigrants, and it was good for Americachanged the president and the Congress changed the policy that was good forAmerica.(END AUDIO CLIP)MADDOW: That 1924 change, the president and the Congress changed thepolicy. That was good for America.That was Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaking in October 2015 when hewas still senator. He`s speaking on Breitbart Radio with man named SteveBannon who would soon go on to run Donald Trump`s campaign for president.That was surfaced at the time by Right Wing Watch, was picked up in Januaryby The Atlantic. Slate.com picked it up again today.Today, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he was sent out by the presidentto make the announcement that the hundreds of thousands of people who werebrought to this country by their immigrant parents when they were stillkids, those hundreds of thousands of people who had been given leave by theprevious administration to stay in this country legally, they are now ontrack for deportation.NBC News confirming tonight that a set of talking points is distributed bythe White House to offices on Capitol Hill. It advises people who havebeen living here under the DACA program, the Deferred Action for ChildhoodArrivals program, it advises them to, quote, prepare for a departure fromthe United States.So, this affects – I mean, as you`ve been hearing today, this affectsdirectly about 800,000 people who live in the United States. By virtue oftheir participation in the DACA program, you can generalize about thisgroup of people to say they are people who don`t have criminal records,people who are constructively engaged in contributing to society, in themilitary, in college, of gainful employment. We`re going to be talkingtonight about the prospects for exactly how the Trump administration plansto now round these young people up, including the key question of whetherthe information these kids provided to the government in order to join thisprogram will now be used against them, to find them, collar them, send themto countries they have never lived in as adults.It is not an accident that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the one whowas sent out to make this announcement about this today. He is – I mean,Jeff Sessions has a long adult record on this subject, right? He is – heis outspokenly against legal immigration, let alone illegal immigration.For years, he has been an outspoken, unabashed admirer of the eugenics-based, race specific immigration bans of the 1920s Klan era in U.S.politics.But it`s not like we couldn`t see this coming either because of previousechoes in American history or because of the rise of this particularpresident. I mean, Jeff Sessions has always stood for this stuff, but sohas Donald Trump as a public political figure.I mean, even just in presidential politics, he started his presidentialcampaign saying that Mexican immigrants were rapists and in bringing crime.He proposed a ban on Muslims entering this country. He argued repeatedlyand vehemently that a judge of Mexican-American origin could not fairlyserve as a judge in a case involving the Trump business – remember that?He`s a Mexican. He`s a Mexican. He`s a judge born in Indiana, isn`tallowed to judge Trump because he`s a Mexican.Since the election, Trump has claimed that the only reason he lost thepopular vote is because millions of undocumented immigrants somehow votedfor Hillary Clinton, which is not true. He has issued a pardon – hisfirst pardon to a convicted former sheriff who defied a court order inorder to continue to racially profile immigrants in Arizona, despite thefact that it was against the law and there was a court order he needed tofollow on that subject.His administration literally opened an office of immigrant crime to try topromote the visibility of criminal acts by people who are immigrants tothis country, even though immigrants commit fewer crimes than people whoare not immigrants. So, there`s a lot to talk about tonight in terms ofthe specifics, right?In terms of what`s going to happen to the 800,000 DREAMers in communitiesall across this country, and seeing some of the reaction today to this newsin terms of people turning out in the streets, people risking arrest,people protesting, it`s pretty intense stuff. We`ve got some prettyincredible footage from that coming up in just a second.But in terms of where this came from – I mean as far as I can see, we`vecovered the Russia stuff a lot in this show, right? As far as I can see,there are really only two bright through lines for this president, in whatis otherwise been kind of an incoherent and hard to follow mishmash,political ideology from him. There are really only two things that areclear as a bell and never changing.One of them is really unprecedented, which is the president`s strange,continued and unerring insistence on saying nice things about Russia andexcusing their behavior, right? That`s weird. That is unprecedented.But the other through-line, the other thing that is consistent and coherentand unswerving in this administration is vehement antipathy towardimmigrants, blaming immigrants, trying to stir up animosity and hatredtoward immigrants, making immigrants a scapegoat, punishing immigrants foreven sins that are not theirs. Those are the two through lines that I cansee that are consistent in this administration.But unlike the Russia one, this one about immigrants this is notunprecedented. This one taps into a deep, old through-line in this countrythat we have seen before and it is a history that we used to look back onwith astonishment and with shame.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: This was 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today. A lot of people countingdown to that hour today once it was clear what was coming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUSTAVO TORRES, CASA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: I just want to let you know thatis 11:00. Son las once. And we just received information he`s right nowofficial, this administration just ended up DACA.(CHANTING)TORRES: We are here to stay. We are here to keep fighting. We are hereto send a very strong message to this administration – hate doesn`t have aspace in this country. We are going to keep fighting with our DREAMers.We are going to keep fighting with our community for justice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: The woman you can see there in that footage is Monica CamachoPerez. She`s 23 years old. She works for the advocacy group Casa. Shecame to this country 16 years ago, when she was 7 years old. She has neverlived anywhere else other than here since she was 7. She`s a DACArecipient.So, this was D.C. today. Protesters gathered in front of the White House.Protesters also marched to the Trump Hotel in downtown D.C. In New YorkCity, people gathered in front of Trump Tower. More than 30 people wereactually arrested outside Trump Tower.In Denver, Colorado, hundreds of kids from several schools walked out oftheir high schools today. The same thing happens in Phoenix, Arizona.Same thing happened at the University of New Mexico and Albuquerque. Thiswas the University of Arizona in Tucson today.Protests popped up all over the country today, in Nashville and Louisvilleand Austin and San Francisco, in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Sacramentoand San Jose.A line from the White House is that Congress is now supposed to fix whatthe administration just did to set up for deportation these kids who don`thave criminal records, who don`t know any other country other than thisone. Frankly, it`s hard to imagine this Congress having the unified willto tie its own shoes these days, let alone pass legislation to helpimmigrant kids.But it looks like that may be the only way out here of what the presidenthas just done.Joining us now is Cristina Jimenez. She`s the executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.Ms. Jimenez, I really appreciate your time tonight. I know this is a very,very busy time.CRISTINA JIMENEZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNITED WE DREAM: Great to be herewith you, Rachel.MADDOW: So, let me just ask your first reaction today. We – you knew aswell as we did that this was probably coming mid-morning today. How didyou hear about it and how do you feel?JIMENEZ: Rachel, since the day of the election, Donald Trump around thecampaign committing to end the DACA program, and the anxiety and the fearand our community has been rising. And so, today is a very difficult dayfor families like mine. My brother Jonathan who`s 23 years old is one ofthe close to million young people that have benefited from the DACAprogram, that has allowed him to live without the fear of being deported,to go back to school, to help my family out financially because he`s beenable to work. And like him, thousands of young people have received thedifficult news today.So, we are outraged at this decision, Rachel. And I want to be clearedabout something – Sessions mentioned in his speech today that this was allabout DACA being not constitutional.Now, what I want to be cleared about is that this was not a legal decision.This was a political decision, and the reality is that the president didnot have to make this decision. The September 5th deadline was anarbitrary deadline pushed by Attorney General Paxton from Texas.If he wanted to do the right thing, as he had said in multiple interviewsthat he had heart for immigrant youth, if he did have the heart forimmigrant youth, he did not have to make this decision. He could have keptthe program in place. But today, we know that thousands of undocumentedyoung people, and many, many allies are joining us in ensuring that we doall that we can to protect young people.I grew up undocumented, Rachel, and I came out as undocumented and unafraidover 10 years ago and we`re not going back into the shadows and that`s thecommitment that members of United We Dream and immigrant youth across thecountry have.MADDOW: And, Cristina, we`ve been hearing news today, strategizing today,about a legal fight in the future, about various entities and even statesconsidering bringing this matter into the courts and trying to stop it thatway. Beyond whatever may happen in terms of a litigation strategy and Ithink that`s sort of yet to be understood in terms of how viable thosestrategies are, do you expect is going to be a direct action resistance tothis as well, that there`s going to be direct community resistance to tryto protect people and stop deportations in a physical way, in terms ofprotest and confrontation?JIMENEZ: I mean, if there`s anything that that we show today is that notonly undocumented young people in our communities but many of our allies,faith leaders, educators business leaders that have come out from theDemocratic side, from the Republican side, we have the majority of thecountry standing in favor of the DACA program, standing in favor ofundocumented young people. You show the images of the walkouts of happenin new Mexico, in Colorado, the direct actions that happen in Washington,D.C. I was there with thousands of people that join the actions in D.C.So, what is very clear to us is that we will continue to lead a directaction movement. This is the way that we won DACA, Rachel and I rememberhaving this conversation with you a few years ago in your show, it wasundocumented young people who came out as undocumented and unafraid, shareour stories, led seat-ins, let direct action and marches across thecountry. That`s how we push President Obama to do the right thing andthat`s what we are determined to do, because we are very clear, Rachel,that this is – that this decision about terminating DACA, it was apriority led by white supremacist in the administration, folks like Millerand Jeff Sessions. This was one of their policy priorities of folks thatwant to drive people like me and my family and my brother out of thiscountry.And so, for us, the intention of the administration and those that areadvising the president is clear, which is why we are ready with allies tocontinue to organize and to push for a permanent solution that will protectyoung people from deportation.MADDOW: Cristina Jimenez, executive director and co-founder of United WeDream – thank you. I know again that this is an incredibly intense time.But what you just said about how DACA came apart came about in the firstplace, I absolutely remember absolutely remember having those conversationswith you watching the power of direct action to make it happen, and thatwill be the most effective tool to try to keep it in place now.Good luck. Keep us apprised.JIMENEZ: Thanks.MADDOW: Thank you.All right. Some unexpected news breaking late tonight in the Trump-Russiainvestigation. It turns out one of the congressional committeesinvestigating the Trump-Russia scandal has now just subpoenaed the FBI,which is as weird as it sounds. But that story`s next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: In 1972, Richard Nixon was about to make history, or at least hewas about to make Republican history. The Republican Party had run RichardNixon from vice president in 1952 and 1956, when he won, right, asEisenhower`s vice presidential running mate in those two elections.Republican Party had also run Richard Nixon for president in 1960 when helost to Kennedy. And then they run him for president again in 1968, whenNixon beat Humphrey.So, heading into the 1972 election, Richard Nixon had already been theRepublican Party`s candidate for president or vice president four differenttimes. So, standing for re-election as president in 1972, Richard Nixonwas due to make history. He was going to match FDR`s record for being onthe national ticket for his party in five different elections.FDR had stood for vice president once. Of course, he stood for presidentfour times, well, finally, in 1972, Nixon was going to match that record.He was going to become as preeminent a figure in Republican politics as FDRhad been to Democratic politics.And so, heading into the 1972 election when he knew he was going to getthat nomination, he wanted to make a big self-centered deal about it,specifically, he wanted to hold the Republican nominating convention thatyear in southern California, where he had been born and raised, where heknew his presidential library would someday be located.The Nixon White House wanted it to be a hometown thing. They picked SanDiego in southern California as the site of the 1972 Republican Conventionfor Nixon to get that historic fifth nomination. And the RNC made thispublic announcement that San Diego was where they were going to hold theirconvention that year.But then they didn`t do it. They had already said the previous year thatit was going to be San Diego. But three months before the convention,three months before Nixon`s triumphant 1972 homecoming, history-makingconvention, they didn`t do it in San Diego at all. They moved it realquick out of San Diego and instead decided to do it in Miami Beach, wherethe Democrats were holding their convention that year already.This is the last time the Republicans and Democrats held their conventionin the same city, and it was a last-minute change by the Republicans thatforced it to happen. So, this radical late change to dump San Diego and gowith Miami instead totally messed with Nixon`s plan to get his moment inthe sun in his home state, with that final historic fifth nomination.The whole reason they had to make that change and dump the San Diego ideais because of this guy, Jack Anderson, legendary columnist andinvestigative reporter. In February 1972, Jack Anderson got something red-hot. He got his hands on a memo that had been written by a lobbyist forthe big phone company at the time, ITT. And in the memo, which was markedfor internal use only at ITT, the lobbyist laid out how that company, ITT,had made a surreptitious deal with Nixon`s Justice Department.The Justice Department under Nixon had been pursuing an antitrust lawsuitagainst ITT, trying to stop that company from gobbling up other companiesand becoming an even larger conglomerate. ITT did not like that legalpursuit by the Justice Department. To try to evade that legal scrutiny, totry to squirm out of that antitrust case, they made this secret deal. TheJustice Department would go easy on ITT for an antitrust case, and inexchange, Nixon`s beloved San Diego convention would get that much closerto reality because ITT would make a huge monetary donation to thatconvention. They donate $400,000, which in today`s dollars would be like acouple million bucks.So, Jack Anderson got that scooped he got that memo, that internal memofrom ITT, and he wrote about it, and the whole thing just blew up. Andsuddenly, the San Diego Republican Convention didn`t seem like such a goodidea anymore. The ITT lobbyists tried to claim the memo wasn`t real, butby that point, the FBI had already authenticated it. Then it turned out,the FBI had been pressured by the White House, by the Nixon White House tonot authenticate it, to disprove the memo and call it a forgery even thoughit wasn`t,Then, the Senate Watergate Committee turned up an internal White House memothat warned that the president himself appeared to have been directlyinvolved in arranging this corrupt ITT deal to drop that prosecution inexchange for the donation. It all just – it all just spiraled.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TV ANCHOR: Attorney General Elliot Richardson today asked the specialWatergate prosecutor Archibald Cox to look into a government investigationof last year`s controversial merger of the International Telephone andTelegraph Company with the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. This couldmean that IT&T may be drawn into the Watergate scandals.REPORTER: The FBI has conducted an extensive investigation into the casein recent weeks and has come up with a great deal of new evidence. Thisevidence is now being studied by a team of four lawyers working under thegovernment special prosecutor Archibald Cox. The evidence is regarded asso incriminating that a prosecution already is being planned.(END VIDEO CLIP)MADDOW: So, the special prosecutor who was already looking into theWatergate scandal came across this other thing, this ITT thing, this otherscandal in the Nixon White House came across it in the course of theWatergate investigation and even though it had nothing to do with theWatergate break-in at the Democratic Party`s headquarters or the efforts tocover that up, the special prosecutor still went after it.Within the Watergate investigation, the special prosecutor set up aninternal task force to work on that ITT thing specifically, dropping theprosecution in exchange for that donation. It was basically an offshootinvestigation within the Watergate special prosecution, even though itwasn`t related to anything the prosecutor had originally set out touncover.And you can see that lines here as they found out about it at the time.1973, Cox bolsters team investigating ITT. That`s the Watergate specialprosecutor Archibald Cox bulking up his team to look for evidence ofperjury and obstruction of justice in the ITT scandal.And, of course, Nixon ultimately fired the special prosecutor ArchibaldCox, but he couldn`t kill the Watergate investigation just by firingpeople. And eventually, the Watergate investigation that led to Nixon`sresignation, it also led to the first ever criminal conviction of a U.S.attorney general. Nixon`s Attorney General Richard Kleindienst had liedabout the ITT scandal during his confirmation hearing, and he got nailedfor it, because of the task force that was set up under the Watergatespecial prosecutor to look at that specific thing.So, what started with a check for $400,000, and a supposedly triumphanthomecoming Republican convention for an insecure president, that discrete,standalone, quid pro quo corruption scandal, unrelated to the Watergatebreak-in and the Watergate cover-up, that ITT scandal, making thatantitrust case go away in exchange for money, that separate distinctscandal got vacuumed up into the special prosecutor`s investigation and iteventually resulted in a guilty plea from a U.S. attorney general.And you know what, had Gerald Ford not pardoned Richard Nixon, that ITTtask force might eventually have led to charges against Nixon, too, becauseNixon really was caught on tape explaining how he`d taken care of thatwhole ITT prosecution at the Justice Department.So that – that ITT case has always been a very interesting loose threadfrom Watergate, right? It looms large and the what-if questions about whatcriminal charges Nixon might have faced if Ford hadn`t pardoned him. Italso looms over the potential obstruction of justice questions involvingPresident Trump`s first use of the pardon power.If Trump has, as has been reported, if Trump in fact tried to get hisJustice Department to quash the federal prosecution of convicted SheriffJoe Arpaio before Trump issued him a pardon, then that successful ITT taskforce that was formed by the Watergate special prosecutor in the 1970s,well, that`s the model for how the Robert Mueller special counselinvestigation now might expand its inquiries to cover that potentialobstruction of justice related to the Arpaio pardon today.We know that the Mueller investigation is already looking into potentialobstruction of justice and Trump`s firing of the FBI Director James Comey.In fact, we know there is a new wrinkle that has come up in that part ofthe investigation and that`s coming up with Congressman Adam Schiff.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: So, tonight, we`re getting some, frankly, strange new reporting,about subpoenas coming from the House Intelligence Committee, subpoenasthat relate to the dossier of alleged Russian dirt on Donald Trump that wasprepared by a former MI-6 officer and that was published to greatcontroversy by BuzzFeed in January.It`s The Washington Examiner, that conservative outlet, that`s reportingtonight that the House Intelligence Committee has now sent subpoenas aboutthat Trump-Russia dossier to the FBI and to the Department of Justice. So,this is not the Department of Justice or the FBI issuing subpoenas, right?This is like – this is Congress subpoenaing the FBI. Does that meanthey`re trying to force the Mueller investigation to hand over stuff toCongress? What does this mean?As The Washington Examiner describes it tonight, quote: The subpoena is -- excuse me – as The Washington Examiner describes it tonight, thesubpoena is for documents, quote, relating to the dossier, the FBI`srelationship with dossier author Christopher Steele, and, quote, thebureau`s possible role in supporting what began as an opposition researchproject against candidate Donald Trump in the final months of last year`spresidential campaign.They`re mad at the FBI and they want information from the FBI about themreceiving the dossier? According to this reporting tonight, the FBI andthe Justice Department were given a deadline of September 1st to hand overdocuments related to these requests, a deadline that they did not meet.This latest news about the subpoenas comes, of course, amid tension withinthe House Intelligence Committee.Last week, the top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, warned that theinvestigation in that committee might result in two separate partisanreports, one by the Democrats, one by the Republicans. That came afterreports that two Republican staffers on the committee flew to London thissummer unbeknownst to the other members of the committee apparently in aneffort to contact the author of the dossier, ex-British MI-6 agentChristopher Steele.That move prompted Democrats to start voicing their fears that theirRepublican counterparts were more interested in trying to discredit theChristopher Steele dossier rather than trying to substantiate itsallegations. And now, we have these new subpoenas from the committee tothe FBI and to the Justice Department demanding documents related to thedossier.I`m not quite sure what to make of this, but I am very happy to say thatjoining us now is Adam Schiff. He`s the top Democrat on the IntelligenceCommittee in the House.Congressman Schiff, thank you for being here tonight. I really appreciateyour time.REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: You bet. Thank you, Rachel.MADDOW: I described this as strange news and I will admit to being alittle bit baffled by this. Can I just ask if this is something that youwere surprised to learn tonight? Did you know this was happening? And canyou help me understand what it means?SCHIFF: Well, during the recess, we were informed that the majority wantedto send subpoenas to the DOJ and FBI requesting these documents, which Ithink perplexed us because we hadn`t even made a voluntary request to byletter for the information. We have a committee practice, we don`tsubpoena parties unless they turn down our request for information, whichthe FBI and DOJ really hadn`t done.So, we opposed it. We thought it wasn`t warranted. They told us they weregoing to do it anyway.And this also stood in stark contrast to a different situation where we hadrequested twice in writing documents from the White House any tapes ormemoranda reflecting conversations between the president and Director Comeyand the White House basically sent us misleading and incomplete replies andthere, we really should subpoena the White House but they have not beenwilling.So, I was concerned about both the disparate treatment here, but alsoreally trying to antagonize the FBI and DOJ, trying to provoke a conflictpotentially special counsel. I think, Rachel, basically what`s going onhere is you know something that I saw back in my days as a prosecutor,sometimes the defense opts for a strategy of trying to put the governmenton trial and here, I think there`s a hope that if they can impeachChristopher Steele and they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, maybe they canimpeach the whole Russia investigation.But that`s not our purpose. It`s really at cross-purposes we ought to betrying to figure out how much is accurate within what Mr. Steele reported,not trying to discredit him for some reason.MADDOW: Are they – I mean, I don`t want to ask you to put words in theirmouth and I know that you can really only speak for yourself and you`revery careful about that in terms of dealing with your colleagues on thecommittee. But I don`t really understand the point that they`re trying tomake. Are they trying to create a counter-narrative in which the existenceof the dossier is itself a scandal, that that`s the Russia scandal, thatthe dossier itself is the original sin and that that therefore the FBI isparticipating in some sort of Russian plot when it comes to the dossier?SCHIFF: You know, I honestly don`t really understand what they hope toaccomplish with this. Maybe they can discredit Mr. Steele, although he`sheld in very high regard within the intelligence community. Maybe theywant to discredit people in the FBI or the Department of Justice.But what`s to be gained about that? It doesn`t undercut the fact thatRussia hacked our election institutions and tried to influence the outcomeof our election. It`s only going to impede our ability to get at thefacts. So, I don`t really understand what they hope to accomplish fromthis.But I am disturbed at this quite evident double standard of subpoenaagencies for public effect I think that`s really what was designed hererather than investigatory purposed and where we really do have a need forsubpoenas as in the case when the White House refuses to voluntary requeststo comply, we can`t get their acquiescence in the subpoena.So, it is a worrying trend.MADDOW: And I`m all that familiar with what the FBI is required to do inresponse to a subpoena like this. This just isn`t a process that I`m allthat familiar with.Is there anything that could be done through this process? Is thereanything that Mike Conaway or Devin Nunez could do on your committee toreally interfere with the Mueller investigation or to either I guess forcedthem to disclose stuff that might impede their ability to prosecute andinvestigate this? Or otherwise screw with what the special counsel isdoing?SCHIFF: Well, you know, they certainly could make the department andspecial counsel`s life difficult if their subpoena materials that are partof the investigative work product that the department normally would notshare with Congress. And so, yes, it could create real problems. Now,here, they`ve threatened to bring the attorney general in open sessionbefore our committee. Frankly, many of us would welcome that, welcome thechance to question the attorney general under oath. I have a hard timebelieving they would actually fall through on that threat. Butnonetheless, we would welcome the opportunity to have him testify beforethe committee.But we don`t want to interfere and anything that Bob Mueller is doing andwe made it clear and committed at the outset, we would do our best tocoordinate so that we wouldn`t. This to me violates that commitment to thespecial counsel, and I leave it to my colleagues in the majority to explainwhy they`re doing this, why this confrontation with the Department ofJustice which seems so wholly unwarranted.MADDOW: Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the HouseIntelligence Committee – thank you for joining us on short notice tonight,sir. It`s nice to see you.SCHIFF: Thanks, Rachel. You too.MADDOW: Thanks.All right. More ahead tonight. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: We just set a new record. Hurricane Irma is now the most powerfulhurricane ever recorded in the open Atlantic. It`s not even two weekssince Harvey slammed ashore in Texas, but if you haven`t been payingattention to this next storm Irma yet, this is the time to start worryingabout it.Forecasters are saying this could be worse than Harvey. The NationalHurricane Center calls it potentially catastrophic. It`s a category 5storm and then some. Sustained winds of up to 185 miles per hour, which isinsane even for hurricane winds. It`s also big. It`s over miles wide,which is larger than the state of Ohio.Florida`s already declared a state of emergency. There`s mandatoryevacuation in the Keys starting tomorrow. The mayor of Miami`s toldeverybody to stockpile at least three days of food and water and medicineand fuel. But ahead of that potential mainland threat, tonight, Irma isalready a life threatening storm for people on the islands of Barbuda andAntigua where the storm is expected to hit. As early as tonight, we`realready seeing some of these harrowing images from those islands.Irma is also a very real threat to the residents of Puerto Rico. Latetonight, the president declared a state of emergency of Puerto Rico, aswell as the U.S. Virgin Islands. Officials have been warning that acombination of the size of the storm and challenges to the infrastructureand the election the electrical grid in Puerto Rico means that certainparts of Puerto Rico could be out of power for up to six months once thisstorm hits.And then as I said, starting Friday, Florida could get hit with the firstedge of this, the tropical storm force winds. The latest models show Irmamaking landfall mainland sometime over the weekend. So, forecasters sayAmericans from Texas to Virginia need to be on alert, but prayers for theCaribbean tonight. I`ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: I just want to real quick underscore two things as we wrap uptonight.First, this Washington Examiner report tonight which I just spoke aboutwith – spoke with Adam Schiff about. This may be important. If thisbears out, this may be the first real substantive effort by Republicans inCongress to mess with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller,these subpoenas they`ve now sent to the FBI and the Justice Department.They apparently haven`t gotten a response yet, but this does look like itmay be the first real salvo by congressional Republicans to try tointerfere with the Bob Mueller inquiry. So, stick a pin in that. That`sone.Second thing to underscore tonight is that Lawrence O`Donnell has SenatorKamala Harris from California on his show tonight. She never talks toanybody on cable news. She`s talking to Lawrence tonight.That does it for us tonight.Now, it`s time for THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL.Good evening, Lawrence. CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST, ALL IN: That is  ALL IN  for this evening. THE  RACHEL MADDOW SHOW start right now. Good evening, Rachel.  RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Chris. Thank you, my friend. Have a great weekend.  HAYES: You bet. You too.  MADDOW: Thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Happy Friday. President Barack Obama tried very hard to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo in Cuba throughout his two terms as president. It was a campaign promise that he tried to keep, that he intended to keep, that I think he thought he would keep.  But in the end, Congress really was able to thwart those efforts by the president and his administration and Guantanamo was still open for business by the time Obama left office. To people who served in the Obama administration, and particularly people that worked on that issue in the Obama administration, I think that was a real disappointment from President Obama`s two terms, that they weren`t able to get Guantanamo closed, even though they really wanted to.  But that said, they also didn`t send a single new prisoner there for the entire eight years that Obama was president. For eight years, nobody was added to the prisoner population at Guantanamo.  Well, now that Donald Trump is president, this week, we did add our first new name in eight years to the prisoner roster at Guantanamo. The new guy at Guantanamo, as of Wednesday this week, is Brigadier General John Baker of the United States Marine Corps. He`s the second highest ranking lawyer in the United States Marine Corps. He`s the chief defense counsel in the military commissions that are held at Guantanamo.  And as we reported here for the first time on Wednesday night, a judge at Guantanamo, who incidentally, I should tell you, is just a colonel, he locked up this general at Guantanamo on Wednesday to start a period of confinement that was due to last 21 days. The general ended up serving 2- 1/2 days of that sentence at Guantanamo, but today we can report that he`s out. The second highest ranking lawyer in the United States Marine Corps has been freed from custody at Guantanamo.  In fact, this is a snapshot that  Miami Herald  reporter Carol Rosenberg took of the general, who does not seem all that happy about Carol Rosenberg taking his picture today. But this is documentary proof of him after he was released from custody, and whereupon he immediately headed back to his office at Guantanamo where he works on the defense side in the pseudo-court system that`s set up down there.  Now, the reason the general was freed from custody today, is because of a ruling there this – the Pentagon – it`s sort of a Pentagon overseer of the military commissions at Guantanamo. Honestly, my read of this, it seems like the Pentagon might have intervened and freed the marine general who they had locked up. I think they might have done that today largely to prevent a civilian judge in a normal court in the United States from ordering him to be freed either today or over the weekend. I think they wanted to head off that possibility.  But even though as of tonight they`re no longer locking up a brigadier general from the Marine Corps, that pseudo court system they`re running down at Guantanamo, it really is completely imploding. This morning, three civilian defense lawyers who are defending a guy who is accused of the USS Cole bombing from back in 2000, the judge ordered those civilian lawyers to appear by video link to represent their client, even though these three defense lawyers have quit in protests. They say they can`t ethically represent him. The judge ordered them all to appear anyway.  Today, they didn`t appear. So what? So, what`s going to happen now? Is the judge going to have these civilian lawyers arrested? The U.S. military is going to issue an order in Cuba that three American civilians in the United States should be arrested and then flown to a foreign country where they will be forced to provide legal services against their will and against their professional ethics for a defendant they say they no longer represent or speak to? Really?  I mean, maybe the judge will try to force the lawyers to do that by video link from the War Court headquarters in Virginia, even though the lawyers live all over the United States. Maybe they`ll force them to go to Cuba. It`s insane.  So, this brigadier general in the Marine Corps has now been freed against the wishes of the judge at Guantanamo. The lawyers are still on the loose in the United States, and they`re refusing to go to Guantanamo, either in person or by video link.  But the judge is trying to force the proceedings to go ahead any way, and we don`t know what he`s going to do. We don`t know what he`s going to do to those lawyers, we don`t know what is going to happen to the marine corps general, who has just been freed against the judge`s will.  We`re all sort of waiting until Monday morning to figure out how that made up court system at Guantanamo is going to continue to explode, because it`s going to continue to explode. It`s not going to fix itself. It just appears to have come to the end of the legal life support system that has been limping along on for so long. And that story about stuff going wrong at Guantanamo is fascinating in its own right, right?  I mean, military commissions at Guantanamo over their 16-year life span, they`ve convicted a total of eight people and four of those convictions have been overturned. And now, the system itself is dissolving. And the only people that now appear to be able to convict and lock up are defense lawyers and American generals. It`s just – it`s getting really weird. And that is a story that is worth telling and worth knowing about in its own right.  But that story got an extra special spotlight put on it this week, in particular because the day after the terrorist attack in New York City this week, in which eight people were killed by a man pledging allegiance to ISIS, the day after that attack on Tuesday, the president told reporters that, in his view, the normal judicial system in the United States is a joke and a laughing stock, and he says that he would prefer to send the suspect from that terrorist attack to Guantanamo. That was the same day the justice system at Guantanamo locked up a brigadier general in the Marine Corps.  Sure, it seems like that system is working just as designed. I`m not sure if the president saw any coverage of that problem or he somehow got wind of the fact that things were actually falling apart at Guantanamo. But the next day after he said he wanted to send that suspect to Guantanamo, the next day he apparently changed his mind and said, no, now he thinks the New York City terrorism attack suspect should not go to Guantanamo, he should caps lock, get the death penalty!  OK, I don`t know if nobody has explained this to the president or if the president knows this and he doesn`t care, but whether or not you think the New York City terrorist attack suspect should get the death penalty if he`s convicted, whether or not you think he should get the death penalty, the only way you could assure that that suspect cannot get the death penalty is for the president to make a public case that he should. I mean, there`s a reason presidents don`t comment on ongoing criminal matters, it`s because their remarks as president and commander-in-chief about somebody who`s being tried in any American court, those remarks from the president are viewed as prejudicing the likely outcome of the trial, either in terms of that suspect`s guilt or in terms of the appropriate sentence.  And so, there are really only two ways that a president can directly and dramatically affect the administration of justice in this country. Number one, the president can pardon people. Number two, the president can go down a list of criminal defendants and say, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. I think that person`s guilty. I think that person is super guilty and they definite hi ought to do the maximum sentence. I mean, that`s the other thing a president can do, because when a president does that, when a president makes public pronouncements like that, he gravely interferes with the ability of the justice system to ever legitimately find that person guilty or sentence them without prejudice.  And that`s true either in the normal criminal justice system or in the military justice system, or even in the half baked military commission system that`s blowing up right now at Guantanamo. The president has just to say about somebody who`s on trial, I think this trial ought to end up that way, and the whole – and then you have ensured that the trial will not end up that way.  The president`s remarks about a person`s guilt or innocence and the sentence they should received, those remarks have legal bearing. And so now, because of the president`s tweet, whether or not you think it`s a good thing or not, because of the president`s tweet, the terrorist attack suspect from New York City this week will not ever get the death penalty in this country, because of what President Trump said this week publicly about his case.  And maybe that`s a good thing. Maybe that`s a bad thing, but was it intentional?  Even if nobody explained that consequence to him, even if nobody explained to him, hey, you`re save thing guy`s life by tweeting this, there`s still a reason the president could reasonably have been expected to be mindful of that possibility when he made those remarks about the terrorism suspect this week. There`s a reason you think he might have had it in mind, that there might be a consequence of him saying something about that case. The reason he might have had that on his mind this week is because of Bowe Bergdahl, right?  Bowe Bergdahl walked off base in Afghanistan in 2009. He was picked up within hours by the Taliban, held by them, mostly in cages for five years. He was freed in 2014. The army charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, which is a strange sounding phrase, but it`s a very serious charge, it comes with a possible life sentence. Bowe Bergdahl pled guilty, he didn`t fight the charges.  But when it came to sentencing him, it was President Trump who did all he could as president to make sure that Bowe Bergdahl would get as light a sentence as possible, right? It was a standard feature of Trump`s stump speech during the campaign to denounce Bowe Bergdahl as a traitor. He would even act out the physical act of executing him, to call for Bergdahl to not just be executed, but to be executed in specific ways. He`d say to the crowd, you know, Bergdahl ought to be thrown out of a plane without a parachute. He`d mime about shooting him in the head.  The president said all that stuff during the campaign about Bergdahl and that arguably itself might have had a prejudicial outcome on Bergdahl`s legal proceedings, Trump speaking as a presidential candidate. But then once Trump was president, and he was asked about Bowe Bergdahl, he couldn`t resist. He told reporters that he wanted to remind them of what he`d said about Bergdahl during the campaign. And bingo, just like that, the president personally ensured that some measure of lenience would be shown to Bowe Bergdahl during his sentencing specifically because of President Trump and his inability to not talk about this case.  And in fact, the judge in the Bowe Bergdahl gave notice earlier this week that the president`s inability to stop himself from continuing to talk about Bowe Bergdahl, that would be seen as prejudicial to Bergdahl`s ability to be treated appropriately and fairly within the justice system. It would be seen as, quote, mitigating evidence in deciding Bergdahl`s sentence. And Bowe Bergdahl was sentenced today. He was sentenced to a loss in rank, a fine, dishonorable discharge, nut no prison time.  Prosecutors asked for 14 years, he got none prison time. And upon that sentence being handed down today in consideration of the mitigating evidence of the president trying to weigh in on how Bergdahl should be treated, once that sentence got handed down today, the president did it again. He put out a public response as president, as commander in chief, to the Bergdahl sentencing, calling it a complete and total disgrace to our country and to our military. And I hope that felt great to the president to get that off his chest.  But you know what? The practical effect of him getting that off his chest is that Bergdahl`s lawyers will use that in their appeal. And their appeal is going forward and because everybody in the military has to answer to the commander-in-chief and the commander-in-chief has now expressed his personal displeasure with the lenience of the initial sentence in this case.  That means in practical terms that further legal proceedings against Bowe Bergdahl will also have to mitigate against the impact of the president`s comments today. They will have to adjust to the way they treat Bergdahl in court to account for the fact that the military justice system will now be inherently biased against him because of those words expressed on Twitter today by the commander-in-chief. Oops.  The president is not the top law enforcement official in the country. The president is the head of the executive branch. The administration of justice, both in military and civilian courts, is supposed to be conducted and removed from all political concerns and certainly removed from the personal interests of anybody in government, including the president himself. There really are only a couple of exceptions to that. One exception is the thing that presidents do on purpose. One exception is the thing that presidents do when they`re drunk or when they screw up or when their faculties momentarily desert them.  I mean, the one they do on purpose is they use the power of the pardon, right? They can commute sentences. They can pardon people for federal convictions. That`s the one they do on purpose.  The one that presidents can do when they screw up is by guaranteeing the justice system will lean in the opposite direction of a preference expressed by the president during an ongoing criminal proceeding, so as to compensate for the president`s undue influence over that matter of justice, right? You can do it on purpose or you can oops.  So far, the president has pardoned one person, Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona. And in terms of oops, he`s blundered into at least a handful of other criminal cases, including two just this week. And I think it`s worth being clear how the president has exerted himself when it comes to the administration of justice, either on purpose or my accident, because the president now appears to have started a fourth round, a fourth round of strange and I think not quite what it seems open conflict with the guy who really is the top law enforcement official in the country, the attorney general of the United States.  In the last couple of days, once on a conservative talk radio show, and today, to reporters at the White House, the president openly lamented the behavior of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He lamented that he doesn`t have – that he the president doesn`t have more personal control over what the Justice Department does. The president has spent the last few days tweeting furiously that the Justice Department and the FBI and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they should be investigating and locking up Hillary Clinton and Democrats.  And that has led to a happy feedback loop in the conservative media where the president says, why isn`t Jeff Sessions jailing Hillary Clinton? And the conservative media says, yes, why isn`t Jeff Sessions locking up Hillary Clinton? And the president says, everybody is wondering why Jeff Sessions isn`t locking up Hillary Clinton.  And these expressions of disgust and disappointment by the president toward his attorney general is being covered now as another like personality fight or another episode of palace intrigue in the administration, with the president and his attorney general not getting along. There seems to be a real conflict between them. I wonder how this will work out.  Let me just put this out there. We have no idea of what`s really going on between Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions. And we have no way of really knowing.  Jeff Sessions was Trump`s earliest supporter in the Senate, they campaigned together for months. Sessions ran a large part of the Trump campaign. Sessions, for his part, has never been known to say a crossword about the president, ever. And maybe there`s some heartfelt personal conflict between them as men. I don`t know, I don`t care.  But I do know that this is the fourth round of this president shoveling public criticism onto this attorney general for a specific reason. And creating an expectation among his base where Jeff Sessions is, as popular as he is, creating an expectation among his base that maybe Jeff Sessions isn`t so great after all, that maybe Jeff Sessions has to go.  And there have been three instances of this before now. We`re having the fourth one now. The first was in March when Jeff Sessions was found to have had contacts with Russians during the campaign, contacts he didn`t disclose, even under oath. When those contacts were exposed, Sessions responded with that news by recusing himself from overseeing the Russian investigation.  Now, that was the very beginning of march. The president reacted to that, the president reacted to Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia issue by going, quote, ballistic. The president erupted with anger. The president feels Sessions` recusal was unnecessary.  So, that was the first time. Trump flashes anger over Sessions` recusal. That was one. The second time was two months later in May. We learned about that one from  The New York Times . Quote,  Shortly after learning in May that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate links between his campaign associates and Russia, President Trump berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an Oval Office meeting and said he should resign.  The president attributed the appointment of the special counsel to Sessions` decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department`s Russia investigation, quote, ashen and emotion. Sessions told the president he would quit. And he sent a resignation letter to the White House. Quote, Trump ended up rejecting Sessions` resignation letter after senior members of his administration argued that dismissing him would only create more problems for the president.  So, the first time the president blew up at Jeff Sessions and let it be known publicly and it resulted in headlines how furious he was at Jeff Sessions, was when Sessions recused himself on the Russia thing in March. And two months later, the president again goes absolutely ballistic at Jeff Sessions, gets a resignation letter from Sessions.  What`s the source of the president`s anger? Again, Jeff Sessions being recused from the Russia investigation.  Then the third time was in July. Now, mid-July was very tough time for the White House on this story, right? The Trump Tower meeting involving his son and his son in law and Paul Manafort and all those Russians, gets exposed by  The New York Times.  The president himself reportedly drafts the initial false statement explaining that way, which immediately gets public disproven by his son`s own e-mails. His son then has to hire a criminal defense attorney, the White House itself has to hire a new Russia lawyer. His son gets threaten with a subpoena. All that is blowing up and very close to home, the president in July opens up another salvo at his attorney general, Jeff Session.  And what`s he so mad about Jeff Session about? Guess.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRUMP: Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.  NYT REPORTER: Was that a mistake?  TRUMP: Well, Sessions should have never recused himself. And if he would – if was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: Why is it so important that Sessions recuse himself? What would you expect him to be doing now in the Justice Department if we were overseeing the Russia investigation?  That was the third big blowup between this president and his attorney general, right, starting yet another round of intensive media coverage of whether or not the attorney general and the president were really fighting, whether they disliked each other, whether he was going to have to go, this terrible rift between the president and the attorney general. How personal is it? It`s emotional, right?  That was – that was the third time. The first one is when he recuses. Second one is when Mueller is appointed. Why did you recuse yourself? That`s why Mueller was appointed.  Third one is when the Trump Tower meeting comes out. Why isn`t he recused? Why did he recuse?  And now, we`re having the fourth one, and this came on indictment week.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MADDOW: So this is now the fourth round of more or less open conflict between this president and his attorney general. Not so much conflict as it is the president shoveling stuff onto the attorney general. And all four times that it`s happened, it appears to be keyed to the Russia investigation and the president`s anger is focused or his – at least the focus on his criticism is on Jeff Sessions recusing himself. Why isn`t he running the Russia investigation?  If you are concerned about the Russia thing, about the Trump campaign, contacts with Russia during the election while Russia was influencing the election to help him, if you`re concerned about that, Jeff Sessions is probably one of the people from the campaign you are concerned about, right? This plea agreement for the Trump foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos that was unsealed this week, in that plea agreement, we now have yet more instances of the attorney general apparently suffering very convenient memory lapses when it comes to him forgetting about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he was definitely in on.  I mean, obviously, he knew about his own meetings with Russian officials during the campaign, but he forgot about them under oath. He knew about this adviser trying to set up meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, but he forgot about them under oath. It now appears that he knew about a Trump campaign adviser taking a trip to Moscow in the middle of the campaign, to go meet with Russian officials. But he forgot about that too under oath.  I mean, if you`re concerned about the Russia contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and in particular the efforts to keep those contacts secret, then Jeff Sessions really is at the heart of what you`re probably concerned about. That said, do you think Trump should fire him? Because the reason Trump wants to fire him is because Sessions is recused from overseeing the Russian investigation. If Trump fires him, he will replace Sessions with somebody who is not recused from overseeing the Russia investigation, someone who would be more to Trump`s liking on that point specifically, because that`s the point that Trump keeps hitting with Sessions. It`s that.  When all of these other things – it`s not. Four times is not a coincidence. Four times, he goes after him on the recusal. It`s the recusal. If he gets rid of sessions, he`s going to put in somebody who will not be recused, and that will be the reason he gets rid of Sessions.  So, should he get rid of him? I mean, if you think the Russia attack and the possibility of the Trump campaign was in on it is a serious national security matter for this country, a serious political crisis for this country, what`s worse? Having an attorney general of the United States, a serving attorney general who is up to his neck in that scandal, what`s worse, that, or not having that attorney general who is up to his neck in that scandal?  I mean, if you`re Congress and you want to go after the bad actors in this scandal, should you go after Jeff Sessions or is Jeff Sessions the one person that you absolutely should not go after under any circumstances no matter what he did because he needs to stay in that job. You tell me.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Every freaking Friday.  You know, there`s a theory as to how to be able to do this kind of a job with longevity, which is why you want to pretape your Friday shows, because you need a little break, you want to get an extra handle on the weekend, get out ahead of the traffic, and besides, nothing happens on Fridays.  We need new common wisdom. We need a new approach to longevity in this job, every Friday.  All right.  The New York Times  has just broken this news. Mark Mazzetti and Adam Goldman are the byline. Trump campaign adviser met with Russian officials in 2016.  All right. This new news just broken by  The New York Times  within the last few minutes. This derives from just one of the lots of people who has testified to the House Intelligence Committee this week. You`re familiar with Carter Page, who was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. There`s been a lot of effort to minimize his role in the Trump campaign since it emerged that he not only turns up in the indictment of a Russian spy ring that was operating in New York City, but he did travel to Moscow during the campaign.  What  The New York Times  has just broken tonight is – it derives from the testimony yesterday – Carter Page`s testimony this week in the House Intelligence Committee. But it seems to confirm two things about a trip that Carter Page took to Moscow during the campaign. It confirms number one that he lied about it publicly. And number two that the campaign definitely knew that he took that trip and he met with Russian government officials on behalf of the Trump campaign during that trip.  In multiple interviews that Carter Page has done with the press, he had according to  The Times  either denied meeting with any Russian government officials during this July 2016 visit or he had sidestepped the question saying he met with mostly scholars. But according to  The New York Times,  quote, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump presidential campaign met Russian government officials during his July 2016 trip that he took to Moscow. So, Carter Page has been mischaracterizing this meeting.  The more important part of this, whether or not you`re invested in Carter Page`s integrity as a person who describes his own history is that he appears to have described his meetings with Russian government officials to the Trump campaign at the time. So when the Trump campaign senior figures say Jeff Sessions or say Donald Trump, when they say they were unaware of anybody having contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, an e- mail that Carter Page sent back to the campaign after his Moscow trip appears to give lie to that.  Joining us now is Mark Mazzetti, Washington investigations editor at  The New York Times , one of the reporters on this new piece about Carter Page that just broken.  Mark, thank you very much for joining us on short notice. I really appreciate it.  MARK MAZZETTI, NEW YORK TIMES WASHINGTON INVESTIGATIONS EDITOR (via telephone): Sure. Thanks, Rachel.  MADDOW: So, Carter Page is an unusual figure because he does a lot of media interviews and he doesn`t appear to have a lawyer and he speaks in ways that make him seem like a comic figure. That said, what you described here is serious in terms of how honest the campaign has been about knowing about Russian contacts by people in the Trump campaign during the campaign. Is that basically the gist of it?  MAZZETTI: Right. I mean, I think the only reason this emerged is because during the testimony yesterday before the House Intelligence Committee, Page was presented with an e-mail that he apparently sent to the campaign after the trip, sort of describing his interactions with government officials, business executives, et cetera. And the e-mails came as a part of the House Intelligence Committee`s investigation and they were produced by the campaign.  And so, as you say, he – Carter Page has been out and about in the media for months.  The New York Times  has talked to him frequently and it`s been very difficult to get any clarity on who he met with, and whether he met with government officials. In some cases, he just flat out denied it. So, that`s why this is significant and it`s significant because he seemed to have notified the campaign about the contacts.  MADDOW: So, and to that point specifically, Mark, one of the things that we heard after he came out of this House Intelligence Committee testimony, the committee was frustrated because he didn`t hand over any documents to them. This e-mail that was produced at the hearing with him while he was giving his testimony was not an e-mail that Carter Page produced saying, I wrote this e-mail to the campaign. Rather, this is an e-mail that the campaign produced, which proves that they received it from him, correct?  MAZZETTI: That is our understanding, yes. The investigators who have been sifting through thousands of e-mails had come across it, and then asked him about it during his testimony yesterday.  MADDOW: And do we know who he sent this e-mail to? Do we have any idea who he either felt he needed to notify about his trip to meet with Russian government officials or who received this e-mail?  MAZZETTI: We don`t. We`re still trying to learn more about that part.  MADDOW: OK. But somebody – it would appear under the circumstances that somebody on the campaign got this, at least to the extent they had it and were able to hand it over to congressional investigators.  MAZZETTI: Right. And it`s – his status at that point, he was still on the campaign officially, and as you know, the campaign tried to distance itself from Page by later that summer, and certainly now, and sort of saying he was an unpaid adviser, he never met with Trump, et cetera. But it did show during the campaign or during that trip in July 2016, he was connected to the people in the campaign and he was still in touch and he was briefing them on what happened.  MADDOW: Including his meetings with Russian government officials in Moscow. Remarkable.  Mark Mazzetti, Washington investigations editor at  The New York Times  – thank you for your time tonight, particularly on short notice, Mark. Congratulations on the scoop.  MAZZETTI: Thank you.  MADDOW: Thanks.  All right. Again, just to underscore what  The New York Times  has just reported, according to these e-mails that have been obtained by the House Intelligence Committee, which were apparently read aloud when Carter Page testified this week, he not only took a trip to Moscow that was approved by the Trump campaign during the campaign, he met with Russian government officials while he was there. He reported on his meetings with Russian government officials back to the campaign. That means that every time people on the campaign denied that they had any knowledge that anybody in the Trump campaign was talking to Russian officials, I don`t know if it means they were lying, but at least there`s evidence that the campaign had been notified that was under way. Fridays.  All right. Much more to come tonight. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: I want to switch gears here for a second. I want to give you a window into what it`s like to report one very difficult, very underreported story in this country right now. By now, by tonight at least we thought we`d be able to give you new information about a story we`ve been working on for a few weeks now.   USA Today  actually had a great update on this today. They spoke with doctors and nurses who are part of the recovery effort in Puerto Rico, who are even now a month and a half after the storm, that island still has not restored electricity or running water. Doctors and nurses at USA Today spoke to are now reporting widespread symptoms related to unclean water in Puerto Rico.  They also published this photo of the kind of water people are getting out of the tap in places where they do have running water right now. Look at the blue color. That`s from a town 20 miles outside of the capital in Puerto Rico.  So, we`ve been following the public health threat posed by the lack of access to water in Puerto Rico and how American citizens in Puerto Rico are having to make do to find whatever water sources they can. There have been very good, very critical reports recently from CNN and  BuzzFeed  about whether or not we know what the overall death toll is in Puerto Rico, especially given evidence that hundreds of bodies were cremated in Puerto Rico soon after the soon, with nobody ever making any determination as to whether those deaths should have been considered storm-related.  Well, in covering the issue of potential water born disease caused by the lack of running water since the storm, we have been chasing the data on how many people have died specifically from water born illnesses since the hurricane, right? The death toll from the storm is only 54, I mean, only 54, 54 which – you know, given that hundreds of bodies were cremated after the storm, there`s a lot of pressure on that number.  The official death toll is 54. The government says of those 54, there are three deaths so far that they attribute to a water-born illness called Leptospirosis, three. Here`s the thing, though, here`s the thing I want to show you. In addition to the three deaths from Lepto that the government says are official, the government also told us that there are another 76 cases that are under suspicion, being investigated. What we have been trying to determine is if that means there are another 76 fatalities they are investigating as having been possibly caused by this water-born illness.  I mean, if we only have an official death toll at 54, is the government looking at another 76 possible deaths here? That is an answerable question. But that is not a question the possibly caused by this water born illness. If we only have an official death toll at 54, is the government looking at another 76 possible deaths here? That is an answerable question. But that is not a question the government will answer, all right?  And this is what I want to show you. This is RACHEL MADDOW SHOW producer Lisa Ferry trying to pry that known and knowable information out of the government. I realize we`re kind of showing you our work here. But just listen to this. I just I want you to hear this. This makes me insane.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRMS: Of those outstanding cases, how many of them are fatalities?  DESADA: OK, what I can say is, that that is under investigation.  TRMS: Is it possible that of those outstanding 70-some-odd cases, that some or many of them are dead?  DESDA: We have to do the confirmation testing. Just make sure that it`s Lepto.  TRMS: Do you even know how many of the 74 cases are fatalities?  DESADA: We have 76 suspected cases. Of those, we have two confirmed fatal cases, and to confirmed hospitalized cases.  TRMS: And of the remaining 72, are any of those fatalities?  DESADA: We have 72 suspected cases that we still have to investigate and confirm or not.  TRMS: But, but, right, you have to investigate whether they`re lepto or not, but do you know if they`re alive or not?  DESADA: First, we have to confirm that they`re positive or not?  TRMS: Do you even know if they`re alive?  DESADA: Yes, we have a list of who is fatal and who`s not and we`re getting Samples from all of them.  TRMS: So, I understand, you won`t – your office won`t confirm if those 76 patients are alive or dead.  DESADA: Well, absolutely, we know who`s dead or not. The thing is, we at this point, once we have those results, we will give that information. Sure.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: Absolutely. We know who`s dead and who`s not. But we`re not going to tell you. We`re not going to release that information yet.  I have to tell you, we`ve been sitting on that for several days now, we`ve been waiting for the  yet . We`ve been waiting to get the information that we are promised there, because the CDC in Atlanta would not tell us. They sent us to Puerto Rico`s department of health. Then the Puerto Rico Department of Health would not tell us.  They sent us to the state epidemiologist, and the state epidemiologist told us that this week, this week, they`d let us know. They`d get – they`d let us know how many dozens of those cases were fatalities, and whether we`re potentially looking at a death toll, not from the storm but from the botched response to the storm that could be more than double what they`re currently admitting to.  They know whether these 70 plus cases they`re investigating of water born illness are through people who have died or from people who haven`t. They know that. But they will not tell us.  Again, they do know how many of the suspected cases of Lepto have been fatal, they just don`t want us to know. The government told us a week ago tonight that they would be announcing the results this week from the CDC in Atlanta, this week, with an updated number of fatalities. We waited all week. It`s Friday night now.  There`s a reason we didn`t do this until now. We`ve been calling. We have been following up. They have not released the numbers, and we will stay on this.  But Puerto Rico tonight still doesn`t have running water. And as far as we can tell, the ongoing death toll, because of that, should be regarded as unknown – at least as of now.  Watch this space.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: In the year 2000, the General Accounting Office released this report: suspicious banking activities, possible money launderings by U.S. corporations formed for Russian entities. It sounds a little boring, I know. But the story that was told in this report about this one particular guy was a very eye-popping story.  They traced in this report, they traced to one guy more than $1.4 billion in suspicious wire transfers that were deposited into 236 different American bank accounts, all from Russia and other Eastern Europe countries. Literally, one guy was running a billion and a half dollars through 236 different American bank accounts. He also personally set up more than 2,000 different shell corporations for Russian citizens. One guy.  That report in 2000 led to changes in the law to make it harder to launder money here in the United States.  The name of that one guy, who was never charged but whose status is the poster child for money laundering, led to changes in American law, he was a dual U.S.-Russian national. A guy named Ike Kaveladze. Does that ring a bell?  That poster child for money laundering, that report on Ike Kaveladze was in the year 2000. It was about his activities during the 1990s. In 2016, that same guy, Ike Kaveladze, turned up at the meeting in Trump Tower last June, which involved Donald Trump, Jr. and Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner. He was there at the Trump Tower meeting.  In the wake of the meeting, we learned that Ike Kaveladze`s partner in that $1.4 billion money laundering scheme from back in the `90s was a Soviet banker with ties to former KGB officers.  Then, a few weeks ago,  The Guardian  newspaper reported that Ike Kaveladze was involved in the 2003 takeover of a U.S. mining company by one of Russia`s wealthiest oligarchs, a very close friend of Vladimir Putin, who personally lobbied President Bush on behalf of that deal.  One of the five people the Russians handpicked to serve on the board of that new company was Ike Kaveladze.  Well, yesterday, Ike Kaveladze turned up again, when he testified behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. And you can imagine there would be a lot of tough questions from members of Congress, right? Considering his past affiliations and the way he`s turned up, right? And even U.S. government reports, right?  What did you learn, Congressman Tom Rooney, Republican member of the committee, what did you learn?  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  REP. TOM ROONEY (R), FLORIDA: He just sort of seemed to be another guy in the room. He was supposed to be there to be a translator and then there happened to be another translator so he didn`t even do that. But he was a very good witness just to sort of like assist us and what, you know, went on during the meeting.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: He was just another guy in the room. He`s a very good witness. Did you Google him?  We have been hearing Republicans in Congress that they want the Trump- Russia probe to wrap up as fast as possible. Maybe this is just me, but how does Ike Kaveladze with his long, lurid, like poster child making history of suspected money laundering and ties to Russian oligarchs and the KGB, how does he end up as just another guy in the room really handy he was there. He was super sweet. I mean, did you know anything about him before you talked to him, member of the intelligence committee, right?  In addition to Ike Kaveladze, the House Intelligence Committee just this week has met with three other witnesses, ex-Justice Department officials Sally Yates and Mary McCord, also with Carter Page, who  The New York Times  reports today, in fact, met with Russian officials during a trip to Moscow last summer and advised the Trump campaign when he returned of how those meetings with Russian officials went.  House Intelligence Committee has been meeting with a lot of very, very important people in the middle of this investigation. Whether they have been prepared for those interviews, I don`t know. But they`re doing a lot of them really fast right now, and I think we might know why that is and that`s next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: So,  The New York Times  breaking news tonight that campaign emails of the Trump campaign show that Carter Page notified the Trump campaign that he met with Russian government officials on his trip to Moscow during the presidential campaign last year. That gives lie to the denials from the Trump campaign that they had any idea there were contacts between their campaign and the Russians.  That revelation comes from  The New York Times , but it also comes from the House Intelligence Committee, which met with Carter Page this week and reportedly read aloud to him that campaign e-mail. But honestly, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of meeting with everybody and their mother right now. They`ve had a ton of high profile witness this week and they`re planning to continue to do that next week. I`m curious as to whether this pace they`re operating at right now might mean that they are wrapping up or maybe they`re just being incredibly efficient.  Joining us now is Kyle Cheney who reports on Congress for politico.com.  Mr. Cheney, thank you for being with us. Appreciate your time.  KYLE CHENEY, CONGRESS REPORTER, POLITICO: Thanks for having me, Rachel.  MADDOW: Is there – am I right to sense that there has been an uptick in the pace, particularly in this House committee?  CHENEY: No question. And I mean, this committee if you remember back they were absolutely hobbled by partisanship for months in a bay people wondered if they would gate investigation off the ground at all. So, it`s not totally surprising that they`re suddenly – they righted that ship a little bit and having people in, but the notable intensification of that pace of bringing in witnesses and not just any witnesses but high-profile witnesses, people close to the president, people close to the campaign gives you a sense that they`re sort of reaching a climax or a crescendo here and maybe nearing the end which I think a lot of Republicans would be happy to hear.  MADDOW: I highlighted the story of Ike Kaveladze and his testimony this week a moment ago, in part because he seems like such an important and complex target given his ties to the Putin government and to money laundering on an epic scale, at least according to a government report.  Is there any sense that the pace of these witnesses might be impeding the ability of the committee to actually prepare to ask them hard questions?  CHENEY: Well, I think you`ve heard frustration from some Democrats of a sense they`re feeling rushed that maybe there`s pressure, political pressure or otherwise to get this thing done with. I don`t think – I mean, they met with Carter Page yesterday for seven hours. Just about seven hours and I think they`re getting ask the questions they want to ask in those windows of time that they`re inside the committee room. But can they synthesize everything and come to any concrete and satisfying solutions that aren`t partisan in nature? That`s the part that I think is frustrating some lawmakers right now, too.  MADDOW: Kyle Cheney, congressional reporter for Politico.com, Kyle, thank you for being with us particularly on a Friday night.  CHENEY: Great to be here.  MADDOW: Really appreciate it.  All right. We`ll be right back. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Lawrence O`Donnell is here tonight in uno minuto, buckled in, ready to go, don`t touch that dial. But I want to advise you on one thing first for your plans for earlier next week. I don`t know if you forgot and made other plans but Tuesday night is – election night. Election night all over the country with big marquee governor`s races in New Jersey and Virginia. You need to check now to see if you need to be voting where you live on Tuesday in any state or local elections. But then, make your plans for Tuesday night to watch all the returns.  Again, sit tight now. Here comes Lawrence, but plan ahead for Tuesday night. There`s going to be special live election night coverage all night Tuesday night right here. You need to cancel whatever else you were planning on doing it.  That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again on Monday.  Now, it`s time for  THE LAST WORD  with great Lawrence O`Donnell.  Good evening, Lawrence. CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST, ALL IN: That is  ALL IN  for this evening. THE  RACHEL MADDOW SHOW start right now. Good evening, Rachel.  RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Chris. Thank you, my friend. Have a great weekend.  HAYES: You bet. You too.  MADDOW: Thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Happy Friday. President Barack Obama tried very hard to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo in Cuba throughout his two terms as president. It was a campaign promise that he tried to keep, that he intended to keep, that I think he thought he would keep.  But in the end, Congress really was able to thwart those efforts by the president and his administration and Guantanamo was still open for business by the time Obama left office. To people who served in the Obama administration, and particularly people that worked on that issue in the Obama administration, I think that was a real disappointment from President Obama`s two terms, that they weren`t able to get Guantanamo closed, even though they really wanted to.  But that said, they also didn`t send a single new prisoner there for the entire eight years that Obama was president. For eight years, nobody was added to the prisoner population at Guantanamo.  Well, now that Donald Trump is president, this week, we did add our first new name in eight years to the prisoner roster at Guantanamo. The new guy at Guantanamo, as of Wednesday this week, is Brigadier General John Baker of the United States Marine Corps. He`s the second highest ranking lawyer in the United States Marine Corps. He`s the chief defense counsel in the military commissions that are held at Guantanamo.  And as we reported here for the first time on Wednesday night, a judge at Guantanamo, who incidentally, I should tell you, is just a colonel, he locked up this general at Guantanamo on Wednesday to start a period of confinement that was due to last 21 days. The general ended up serving 2- 1/2 days of that sentence at Guantanamo, but today we can report that he`s out. The second highest ranking lawyer in the United States Marine Corps has been freed from custody at Guantanamo.  In fact, this is a snapshot that  Miami Herald  reporter Carol Rosenberg took of the general, who does not seem all that happy about Carol Rosenberg taking his picture today. But this is documentary proof of him after he was released from custody, and whereupon he immediately headed back to his office at Guantanamo where he works on the defense side in the pseudo-court system that`s set up down there.  Now, the reason the general was freed from custody today, is because of a ruling there this – the Pentagon – it`s sort of a Pentagon overseer of the military commissions at Guantanamo. Honestly, my read of this, it seems like the Pentagon might have intervened and freed the marine general who they had locked up. I think they might have done that today largely to prevent a civilian judge in a normal court in the United States from ordering him to be freed either today or over the weekend. I think they wanted to head off that possibility.  But even though as of tonight they`re no longer locking up a brigadier general from the Marine Corps, that pseudo court system they`re running down at Guantanamo, it really is completely imploding. This morning, three civilian defense lawyers who are defending a guy who is accused of the USS Cole bombing from back in 2000, the judge ordered those civilian lawyers to appear by video link to represent their client, even though these three defense lawyers have quit in protests. They say they can`t ethically represent him. The judge ordered them all to appear anyway.  Today, they didn`t appear. So what? So, what`s going to happen now? Is the judge going to have these civilian lawyers arrested? The U.S. military is going to issue an order in Cuba that three American civilians in the United States should be arrested and then flown to a foreign country where they will be forced to provide legal services against their will and against their professional ethics for a defendant they say they no longer represent or speak to? Really?  I mean, maybe the judge will try to force the lawyers to do that by video link from the War Court headquarters in Virginia, even though the lawyers live all over the United States. Maybe they`ll force them to go to Cuba. It`s insane.  So, this brigadier general in the Marine Corps has now been freed against the wishes of the judge at Guantanamo. The lawyers are still on the loose in the United States, and they`re refusing to go to Guantanamo, either in person or by video link.  But the judge is trying to force the proceedings to go ahead any way, and we don`t know what he`s going to do. We don`t know what he`s going to do to those lawyers, we don`t know what is going to happen to the marine corps general, who has just been freed against the judge`s will.  We`re all sort of waiting until Monday morning to figure out how that made up court system at Guantanamo is going to continue to explode, because it`s going to continue to explode. It`s not going to fix itself. It just appears to have come to the end of the legal life support system that has been limping along on for so long. And that story about stuff going wrong at Guantanamo is fascinating in its own right, right?  I mean, military commissions at Guantanamo over their 16-year life span, they`ve convicted a total of eight people and four of those convictions have been overturned. And now, the system itself is dissolving. And the only people that now appear to be able to convict and lock up are defense lawyers and American generals. It`s just – it`s getting really weird. And that is a story that is worth telling and worth knowing about in its own right.  But that story got an extra special spotlight put on it this week, in particular because the day after the terrorist attack in New York City this week, in which eight people were killed by a man pledging allegiance to ISIS, the day after that attack on Tuesday, the president told reporters that, in his view, the normal judicial system in the United States is a joke and a laughing stock, and he says that he would prefer to send the suspect from that terrorist attack to Guantanamo. That was the same day the justice system at Guantanamo locked up a brigadier general in the Marine Corps.  Sure, it seems like that system is working just as designed. I`m not sure if the president saw any coverage of that problem or he somehow got wind of the fact that things were actually falling apart at Guantanamo. But the next day after he said he wanted to send that suspect to Guantanamo, the next day he apparently changed his mind and said, no, now he thinks the New York City terrorism attack suspect should not go to Guantanamo, he should caps lock, get the death penalty!  OK, I don`t know if nobody has explained this to the president or if the president knows this and he doesn`t care, but whether or not you think the New York City terrorist attack suspect should get the death penalty if he`s convicted, whether or not you think he should get the death penalty, the only way you could assure that that suspect cannot get the death penalty is for the president to make a public case that he should. I mean, there`s a reason presidents don`t comment on ongoing criminal matters, it`s because their remarks as president and commander-in-chief about somebody who`s being tried in any American court, those remarks from the president are viewed as prejudicing the likely outcome of the trial, either in terms of that suspect`s guilt or in terms of the appropriate sentence.  And so, there are really only two ways that a president can directly and dramatically affect the administration of justice in this country. Number one, the president can pardon people. Number two, the president can go down a list of criminal defendants and say, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. I think that person`s guilty. I think that person is super guilty and they definite hi ought to do the maximum sentence. I mean, that`s the other thing a president can do, because when a president does that, when a president makes public pronouncements like that, he gravely interferes with the ability of the justice system to ever legitimately find that person guilty or sentence them without prejudice.  And that`s true either in the normal criminal justice system or in the military justice system, or even in the half baked military commission system that`s blowing up right now at Guantanamo. The president has just to say about somebody who`s on trial, I think this trial ought to end up that way, and the whole – and then you have ensured that the trial will not end up that way.  The president`s remarks about a person`s guilt or innocence and the sentence they should received, those remarks have legal bearing. And so now, because of the president`s tweet, whether or not you think it`s a good thing or not, because of the president`s tweet, the terrorist attack suspect from New York City this week will not ever get the death penalty in this country, because of what President Trump said this week publicly about his case.  And maybe that`s a good thing. Maybe that`s a bad thing, but was it intentional?  Even if nobody explained that consequence to him, even if nobody explained to him, hey, you`re save thing guy`s life by tweeting this, there`s still a reason the president could reasonably have been expected to be mindful of that possibility when he made those remarks about the terrorism suspect this week. There`s a reason you think he might have had it in mind, that there might be a consequence of him saying something about that case. The reason he might have had that on his mind this week is because of Bowe Bergdahl, right?  Bowe Bergdahl walked off base in Afghanistan in 2009. He was picked up within hours by the Taliban, held by them, mostly in cages for five years. He was freed in 2014. The army charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, which is a strange sounding phrase, but it`s a very serious charge, it comes with a possible life sentence. Bowe Bergdahl pled guilty, he didn`t fight the charges.  But when it came to sentencing him, it was President Trump who did all he could as president to make sure that Bowe Bergdahl would get as light a sentence as possible, right? It was a standard feature of Trump`s stump speech during the campaign to denounce Bowe Bergdahl as a traitor. He would even act out the physical act of executing him, to call for Bergdahl to not just be executed, but to be executed in specific ways. He`d say to the crowd, you know, Bergdahl ought to be thrown out of a plane without a parachute. He`d mime about shooting him in the head.  The president said all that stuff during the campaign about Bergdahl and that arguably itself might have had a prejudicial outcome on Bergdahl`s legal proceedings, Trump speaking as a presidential candidate. But then once Trump was president, and he was asked about Bowe Bergdahl, he couldn`t resist. He told reporters that he wanted to remind them of what he`d said about Bergdahl during the campaign. And bingo, just like that, the president personally ensured that some measure of lenience would be shown to Bowe Bergdahl during his sentencing specifically because of President Trump and his inability to not talk about this case.  And in fact, the judge in the Bowe Bergdahl gave notice earlier this week that the president`s inability to stop himself from continuing to talk about Bowe Bergdahl, that would be seen as prejudicial to Bergdahl`s ability to be treated appropriately and fairly within the justice system. It would be seen as, quote, mitigating evidence in deciding Bergdahl`s sentence. And Bowe Bergdahl was sentenced today. He was sentenced to a loss in rank, a fine, dishonorable discharge, nut no prison time.  Prosecutors asked for 14 years, he got none prison time. And upon that sentence being handed down today in consideration of the mitigating evidence of the president trying to weigh in on how Bergdahl should be treated, once that sentence got handed down today, the president did it again. He put out a public response as president, as commander in chief, to the Bergdahl sentencing, calling it a complete and total disgrace to our country and to our military. And I hope that felt great to the president to get that off his chest.  But you know what? The practical effect of him getting that off his chest is that Bergdahl`s lawyers will use that in their appeal. And their appeal is going forward and because everybody in the military has to answer to the commander-in-chief and the commander-in-chief has now expressed his personal displeasure with the lenience of the initial sentence in this case.  That means in practical terms that further legal proceedings against Bowe Bergdahl will also have to mitigate against the impact of the president`s comments today. They will have to adjust to the way they treat Bergdahl in court to account for the fact that the military justice system will now be inherently biased against him because of those words expressed on Twitter today by the commander-in-chief. Oops.  The president is not the top law enforcement official in the country. The president is the head of the executive branch. The administration of justice, both in military and civilian courts, is supposed to be conducted and removed from all political concerns and certainly removed from the personal interests of anybody in government, including the president himself. There really are only a couple of exceptions to that. One exception is the thing that presidents do on purpose. One exception is the thing that presidents do when they`re drunk or when they screw up or when their faculties momentarily desert them.  I mean, the one they do on purpose is they use the power of the pardon, right? They can commute sentences. They can pardon people for federal convictions. That`s the one they do on purpose.  The one that presidents can do when they screw up is by guaranteeing the justice system will lean in the opposite direction of a preference expressed by the president during an ongoing criminal proceeding, so as to compensate for the president`s undue influence over that matter of justice, right? You can do it on purpose or you can oops.  So far, the president has pardoned one person, Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona. And in terms of oops, he`s blundered into at least a handful of other criminal cases, including two just this week. And I think it`s worth being clear how the president has exerted himself when it comes to the administration of justice, either on purpose or my accident, because the president now appears to have started a fourth round, a fourth round of strange and I think not quite what it seems open conflict with the guy who really is the top law enforcement official in the country, the attorney general of the United States.  In the last couple of days, once on a conservative talk radio show, and today, to reporters at the White House, the president openly lamented the behavior of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He lamented that he doesn`t have – that he the president doesn`t have more personal control over what the Justice Department does. The president has spent the last few days tweeting furiously that the Justice Department and the FBI and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they should be investigating and locking up Hillary Clinton and Democrats.  And that has led to a happy feedback loop in the conservative media where the president says, why isn`t Jeff Sessions jailing Hillary Clinton? And the conservative media says, yes, why isn`t Jeff Sessions locking up Hillary Clinton? And the president says, everybody is wondering why Jeff Sessions isn`t locking up Hillary Clinton.  And these expressions of disgust and disappointment by the president toward his attorney general is being covered now as another like personality fight or another episode of palace intrigue in the administration, with the president and his attorney general not getting along. There seems to be a real conflict between them. I wonder how this will work out.  Let me just put this out there. We have no idea of what`s really going on between Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions. And we have no way of really knowing.  Jeff Sessions was Trump`s earliest supporter in the Senate, they campaigned together for months. Sessions ran a large part of the Trump campaign. Sessions, for his part, has never been known to say a crossword about the president, ever. And maybe there`s some heartfelt personal conflict between them as men. I don`t know, I don`t care.  But I do know that this is the fourth round of this president shoveling public criticism onto this attorney general for a specific reason. And creating an expectation among his base where Jeff Sessions is, as popular as he is, creating an expectation among his base that maybe Jeff Sessions isn`t so great after all, that maybe Jeff Sessions has to go.  And there have been three instances of this before now. We`re having the fourth one now. The first was in March when Jeff Sessions was found to have had contacts with Russians during the campaign, contacts he didn`t disclose, even under oath. When those contacts were exposed, Sessions responded with that news by recusing himself from overseeing the Russian investigation.  Now, that was the very beginning of march. The president reacted to that, the president reacted to Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia issue by going, quote, ballistic. The president erupted with anger. The president feels Sessions` recusal was unnecessary.  So, that was the first time. Trump flashes anger over Sessions` recusal. That was one. The second time was two months later in May. We learned about that one from  The New York Times . Quote,  Shortly after learning in May that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate links between his campaign associates and Russia, President Trump berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an Oval Office meeting and said he should resign.  The president attributed the appointment of the special counsel to Sessions` decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department`s Russia investigation, quote, ashen and emotion. Sessions told the president he would quit. And he sent a resignation letter to the White House. Quote, Trump ended up rejecting Sessions` resignation letter after senior members of his administration argued that dismissing him would only create more problems for the president.  So, the first time the president blew up at Jeff Sessions and let it be known publicly and it resulted in headlines how furious he was at Jeff Sessions, was when Sessions recused himself on the Russia thing in March. And two months later, the president again goes absolutely ballistic at Jeff Sessions, gets a resignation letter from Sessions.  What`s the source of the president`s anger? Again, Jeff Sessions being recused from the Russia investigation.  Then the third time was in July. Now, mid-July was very tough time for the White House on this story, right? The Trump Tower meeting involving his son and his son in law and Paul Manafort and all those Russians, gets exposed by  The New York Times.  The president himself reportedly drafts the initial false statement explaining that way, which immediately gets public disproven by his son`s own e-mails. His son then has to hire a criminal defense attorney, the White House itself has to hire a new Russia lawyer. His son gets threaten with a subpoena. All that is blowing up and very close to home, the president in July opens up another salvo at his attorney general, Jeff Session.  And what`s he so mad about Jeff Session about? Guess.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRUMP: Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.  NYT REPORTER: Was that a mistake?  TRUMP: Well, Sessions should have never recused himself. And if he would – if was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: Why is it so important that Sessions recuse himself? What would you expect him to be doing now in the Justice Department if we were overseeing the Russia investigation?  That was the third big blowup between this president and his attorney general, right, starting yet another round of intensive media coverage of whether or not the attorney general and the president were really fighting, whether they disliked each other, whether he was going to have to go, this terrible rift between the president and the attorney general. How personal is it? It`s emotional, right?  That was – that was the third time. The first one is when he recuses. Second one is when Mueller is appointed. Why did you recuse yourself? That`s why Mueller was appointed.  Third one is when the Trump Tower meeting comes out. Why isn`t he recused? Why did he recuse?  And now, we`re having the fourth one, and this came on indictment week.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MADDOW: So this is now the fourth round of more or less open conflict between this president and his attorney general. Not so much conflict as it is the president shoveling stuff onto the attorney general. And all four times that it`s happened, it appears to be keyed to the Russia investigation and the president`s anger is focused or his – at least the focus on his criticism is on Jeff Sessions recusing himself. Why isn`t he running the Russia investigation?  If you are concerned about the Russia thing, about the Trump campaign, contacts with Russia during the election while Russia was influencing the election to help him, if you`re concerned about that, Jeff Sessions is probably one of the people from the campaign you are concerned about, right? This plea agreement for the Trump foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos that was unsealed this week, in that plea agreement, we now have yet more instances of the attorney general apparently suffering very convenient memory lapses when it comes to him forgetting about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he was definitely in on.  I mean, obviously, he knew about his own meetings with Russian officials during the campaign, but he forgot about them under oath. He knew about this adviser trying to set up meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, but he forgot about them under oath. It now appears that he knew about a Trump campaign adviser taking a trip to Moscow in the middle of the campaign, to go meet with Russian officials. But he forgot about that too under oath.  I mean, if you`re concerned about the Russia contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and in particular the efforts to keep those contacts secret, then Jeff Sessions really is at the heart of what you`re probably concerned about. That said, do you think Trump should fire him? Because the reason Trump wants to fire him is because Sessions is recused from overseeing the Russian investigation. If Trump fires him, he will replace Sessions with somebody who is not recused from overseeing the Russia investigation, someone who would be more to Trump`s liking on that point specifically, because that`s the point that Trump keeps hitting with Sessions. It`s that.  When all of these other things – it`s not. Four times is not a coincidence. Four times, he goes after him on the recusal. It`s the recusal. If he gets rid of sessions, he`s going to put in somebody who will not be recused, and that will be the reason he gets rid of Sessions.  So, should he get rid of him? I mean, if you think the Russia attack and the possibility of the Trump campaign was in on it is a serious national security matter for this country, a serious political crisis for this country, what`s worse? Having an attorney general of the United States, a serving attorney general who is up to his neck in that scandal, what`s worse, that, or not having that attorney general who is up to his neck in that scandal?  I mean, if you`re Congress and you want to go after the bad actors in this scandal, should you go after Jeff Sessions or is Jeff Sessions the one person that you absolutely should not go after under any circumstances no matter what he did because he needs to stay in that job. You tell me.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Every freaking Friday.  You know, there`s a theory as to how to be able to do this kind of a job with longevity, which is why you want to pretape your Friday shows, because you need a little break, you want to get an extra handle on the weekend, get out ahead of the traffic, and besides, nothing happens on Fridays.  We need new common wisdom. We need a new approach to longevity in this job, every Friday.  All right.  The New York Times  has just broken this news. Mark Mazzetti and Adam Goldman are the byline. Trump campaign adviser met with Russian officials in 2016.  All right. This new news just broken by  The New York Times  within the last few minutes. This derives from just one of the lots of people who has testified to the House Intelligence Committee this week. You`re familiar with Carter Page, who was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. There`s been a lot of effort to minimize his role in the Trump campaign since it emerged that he not only turns up in the indictment of a Russian spy ring that was operating in New York City, but he did travel to Moscow during the campaign.  What  The New York Times  has just broken tonight is – it derives from the testimony yesterday – Carter Page`s testimony this week in the House Intelligence Committee. But it seems to confirm two things about a trip that Carter Page took to Moscow during the campaign. It confirms number one that he lied about it publicly. And number two that the campaign definitely knew that he took that trip and he met with Russian government officials on behalf of the Trump campaign during that trip.  In multiple interviews that Carter Page has done with the press, he had according to  The Times  either denied meeting with any Russian government officials during this July 2016 visit or he had sidestepped the question saying he met with mostly scholars. But according to  The New York Times,  quote, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump presidential campaign met Russian government officials during his July 2016 trip that he took to Moscow. So, Carter Page has been mischaracterizing this meeting.  The more important part of this, whether or not you`re invested in Carter Page`s integrity as a person who describes his own history is that he appears to have described his meetings with Russian government officials to the Trump campaign at the time. So when the Trump campaign senior figures say Jeff Sessions or say Donald Trump, when they say they were unaware of anybody having contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, an e- mail that Carter Page sent back to the campaign after his Moscow trip appears to give lie to that.  Joining us now is Mark Mazzetti, Washington investigations editor at  The New York Times , one of the reporters on this new piece about Carter Page that just broken.  Mark, thank you very much for joining us on short notice. I really appreciate it.  MARK MAZZETTI, NEW YORK TIMES WASHINGTON INVESTIGATIONS EDITOR (via telephone): Sure. Thanks, Rachel.  MADDOW: So, Carter Page is an unusual figure because he does a lot of media interviews and he doesn`t appear to have a lawyer and he speaks in ways that make him seem like a comic figure. That said, what you described here is serious in terms of how honest the campaign has been about knowing about Russian contacts by people in the Trump campaign during the campaign. Is that basically the gist of it?  MAZZETTI: Right. I mean, I think the only reason this emerged is because during the testimony yesterday before the House Intelligence Committee, Page was presented with an e-mail that he apparently sent to the campaign after the trip, sort of describing his interactions with government officials, business executives, et cetera. And the e-mails came as a part of the House Intelligence Committee`s investigation and they were produced by the campaign.  And so, as you say, he – Carter Page has been out and about in the media for months.  The New York Times  has talked to him frequently and it`s been very difficult to get any clarity on who he met with, and whether he met with government officials. In some cases, he just flat out denied it. So, that`s why this is significant and it`s significant because he seemed to have notified the campaign about the contacts.  MADDOW: So, and to that point specifically, Mark, one of the things that we heard after he came out of this House Intelligence Committee testimony, the committee was frustrated because he didn`t hand over any documents to them. This e-mail that was produced at the hearing with him while he was giving his testimony was not an e-mail that Carter Page produced saying, I wrote this e-mail to the campaign. Rather, this is an e-mail that the campaign produced, which proves that they received it from him, correct?  MAZZETTI: That is our understanding, yes. The investigators who have been sifting through thousands of e-mails had come across it, and then asked him about it during his testimony yesterday.  MADDOW: And do we know who he sent this e-mail to? Do we have any idea who he either felt he needed to notify about his trip to meet with Russian government officials or who received this e-mail?  MAZZETTI: We don`t. We`re still trying to learn more about that part.  MADDOW: OK. But somebody – it would appear under the circumstances that somebody on the campaign got this, at least to the extent they had it and were able to hand it over to congressional investigators.  MAZZETTI: Right. And it`s – his status at that point, he was still on the campaign officially, and as you know, the campaign tried to distance itself from Page by later that summer, and certainly now, and sort of saying he was an unpaid adviser, he never met with Trump, et cetera. But it did show during the campaign or during that trip in July 2016, he was connected to the people in the campaign and he was still in touch and he was briefing them on what happened.  MADDOW: Including his meetings with Russian government officials in Moscow. Remarkable.  Mark Mazzetti, Washington investigations editor at  The New York Times  – thank you for your time tonight, particularly on short notice, Mark. Congratulations on the scoop.  MAZZETTI: Thank you.  MADDOW: Thanks.  All right. Again, just to underscore what  The New York Times  has just reported, according to these e-mails that have been obtained by the House Intelligence Committee, which were apparently read aloud when Carter Page testified this week, he not only took a trip to Moscow that was approved by the Trump campaign during the campaign, he met with Russian government officials while he was there. He reported on his meetings with Russian government officials back to the campaign. That means that every time people on the campaign denied that they had any knowledge that anybody in the Trump campaign was talking to Russian officials, I don`t know if it means they were lying, but at least there`s evidence that the campaign had been notified that was under way. Fridays.  All right. Much more to come tonight. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: I want to switch gears here for a second. I want to give you a window into what it`s like to report one very difficult, very underreported story in this country right now. By now, by tonight at least we thought we`d be able to give you new information about a story we`ve been working on for a few weeks now.   USA Today  actually had a great update on this today. They spoke with doctors and nurses who are part of the recovery effort in Puerto Rico, who are even now a month and a half after the storm, that island still has not restored electricity or running water. Doctors and nurses at USA Today spoke to are now reporting widespread symptoms related to unclean water in Puerto Rico.  They also published this photo of the kind of water people are getting out of the tap in places where they do have running water right now. Look at the blue color. That`s from a town 20 miles outside of the capital in Puerto Rico.  So, we`ve been following the public health threat posed by the lack of access to water in Puerto Rico and how American citizens in Puerto Rico are having to make do to find whatever water sources they can. There have been very good, very critical reports recently from CNN and  BuzzFeed  about whether or not we know what the overall death toll is in Puerto Rico, especially given evidence that hundreds of bodies were cremated in Puerto Rico soon after the soon, with nobody ever making any determination as to whether those deaths should have been considered storm-related.  Well, in covering the issue of potential water born disease caused by the lack of running water since the storm, we have been chasing the data on how many people have died specifically from water born illnesses since the hurricane, right? The death toll from the storm is only 54, I mean, only 54, 54 which – you know, given that hundreds of bodies were cremated after the storm, there`s a lot of pressure on that number.  The official death toll is 54. The government says of those 54, there are three deaths so far that they attribute to a water-born illness called Leptospirosis, three. Here`s the thing, though, here`s the thing I want to show you. In addition to the three deaths from Lepto that the government says are official, the government also told us that there are another 76 cases that are under suspicion, being investigated. What we have been trying to determine is if that means there are another 76 fatalities they are investigating as having been possibly caused by this water-born illness.  I mean, if we only have an official death toll at 54, is the government looking at another 76 possible deaths here? That is an answerable question. But that is not a question the possibly caused by this water born illness. If we only have an official death toll at 54, is the government looking at another 76 possible deaths here? That is an answerable question. But that is not a question the government will answer, all right?  And this is what I want to show you. This is RACHEL MADDOW SHOW producer Lisa Ferry trying to pry that known and knowable information out of the government. I realize we`re kind of showing you our work here. But just listen to this. I just I want you to hear this. This makes me insane.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRMS: Of those outstanding cases, how many of them are fatalities?  DESADA: OK, what I can say is, that that is under investigation.  TRMS: Is it possible that of those outstanding 70-some-odd cases, that some or many of them are dead?  DESDA: We have to do the confirmation testing. Just make sure that it`s Lepto.  TRMS: Do you even know how many of the 74 cases are fatalities?  DESADA: We have 76 suspected cases. Of those, we have two confirmed fatal cases, and to confirmed hospitalized cases.  TRMS: And of the remaining 72, are any of those fatalities?  DESADA: We have 72 suspected cases that we still have to investigate and confirm or not.  TRMS: But, but, right, you have to investigate whether they`re lepto or not, but do you know if they`re alive or not?  DESADA: First, we have to confirm that they`re positive or not?  TRMS: Do you even know if they`re alive?  DESADA: Yes, we have a list of who is fatal and who`s not and we`re getting Samples from all of them.  TRMS: So, I understand, you won`t – your office won`t confirm if those 76 patients are alive or dead.  DESADA: Well, absolutely, we know who`s dead or not. The thing is, we at this point, once we have those results, we will give that information. Sure.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: Absolutely. We know who`s dead and who`s not. But we`re not going to tell you. We`re not going to release that information yet.  I have to tell you, we`ve been sitting on that for several days now, we`ve been waiting for the  yet . We`ve been waiting to get the information that we are promised there, because the CDC in Atlanta would not tell us. They sent us to Puerto Rico`s department of health. Then the Puerto Rico Department of Health would not tell us.  They sent us to the state epidemiologist, and the state epidemiologist told us that this week, this week, they`d let us know. They`d get – they`d let us know how many dozens of those cases were fatalities, and whether we`re potentially looking at a death toll, not from the storm but from the botched response to the storm that could be more than double what they`re currently admitting to.  They know whether these 70 plus cases they`re investigating of water born illness are through people who have died or from people who haven`t. They know that. But they will not tell us.  Again, they do know how many of the suspected cases of Lepto have been fatal, they just don`t want us to know. The government told us a week ago tonight that they would be announcing the results this week from the CDC in Atlanta, this week, with an updated number of fatalities. We waited all week. It`s Friday night now.  There`s a reason we didn`t do this until now. We`ve been calling. We have been following up. They have not released the numbers, and we will stay on this.  But Puerto Rico tonight still doesn`t have running water. And as far as we can tell, the ongoing death toll, because of that, should be regarded as unknown – at least as of now.  Watch this space.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: In the year 2000, the General Accounting Office released this report: suspicious banking activities, possible money launderings by U.S. corporations formed for Russian entities. It sounds a little boring, I know. But the story that was told in this report about this one particular guy was a very eye-popping story.  They traced in this report, they traced to one guy more than $1.4 billion in suspicious wire transfers that were deposited into 236 different American bank accounts, all from Russia and other Eastern Europe countries. Literally, one guy was running a billion and a half dollars through 236 different American bank accounts. He also personally set up more than 2,000 different shell corporations for Russian citizens. One guy.  That report in 2000 led to changes in the law to make it harder to launder money here in the United States.  The name of that one guy, who was never charged but whose status is the poster child for money laundering, led to changes in American law, he was a dual U.S.-Russian national. A guy named Ike Kaveladze. Does that ring a bell?  That poster child for money laundering, that report on Ike Kaveladze was in the year 2000. It was about his activities during the 1990s. In 2016, that same guy, Ike Kaveladze, turned up at the meeting in Trump Tower last June, which involved Donald Trump, Jr. and Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner. He was there at the Trump Tower meeting.  In the wake of the meeting, we learned that Ike Kaveladze`s partner in that $1.4 billion money laundering scheme from back in the `90s was a Soviet banker with ties to former KGB officers.  Then, a few weeks ago,  The Guardian  newspaper reported that Ike Kaveladze was involved in the 2003 takeover of a U.S. mining company by one of Russia`s wealthiest oligarchs, a very close friend of Vladimir Putin, who personally lobbied President Bush on behalf of that deal.  One of the five people the Russians handpicked to serve on the board of that new company was Ike Kaveladze.  Well, yesterday, Ike Kaveladze turned up again, when he testified behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee. And you can imagine there would be a lot of tough questions from members of Congress, right? Considering his past affiliations and the way he`s turned up, right? And even U.S. government reports, right?  What did you learn, Congressman Tom Rooney, Republican member of the committee, what did you learn?  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  REP. TOM ROONEY (R), FLORIDA: He just sort of seemed to be another guy in the room. He was supposed to be there to be a translator and then there happened to be another translator so he didn`t even do that. But he was a very good witness just to sort of like assist us and what, you know, went on during the meeting.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MADDOW: He was just another guy in the room. He`s a very good witness. Did you Google him?  We have been hearing Republicans in Congress that they want the Trump- Russia probe to wrap up as fast as possible. Maybe this is just me, but how does Ike Kaveladze with his long, lurid, like poster child making history of suspected money laundering and ties to Russian oligarchs and the KGB, how does he end up as just another guy in the room really handy he was there. He was super sweet. I mean, did you know anything about him before you talked to him, member of the intelligence committee, right?  In addition to Ike Kaveladze, the House Intelligence Committee just this week has met with three other witnesses, ex-Justice Department officials Sally Yates and Mary McCord, also with Carter Page, who  The New York Times  reports today, in fact, met with Russian officials during a trip to Moscow last summer and advised the Trump campaign when he returned of how those meetings with Russian officials went.  House Intelligence Committee has been meeting with a lot of very, very important people in the middle of this investigation. Whether they have been prepared for those interviews, I don`t know. But they`re doing a lot of them really fast right now, and I think we might know why that is and that`s next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: So,  The New York Times  breaking news tonight that campaign emails of the Trump campaign show that Carter Page notified the Trump campaign that he met with Russian government officials on his trip to Moscow during the presidential campaign last year. That gives lie to the denials from the Trump campaign that they had any idea there were contacts between their campaign and the Russians.  That revelation comes from  The New York Times , but it also comes from the House Intelligence Committee, which met with Carter Page this week and reportedly read aloud to him that campaign e-mail. But honestly, the House Intelligence Committee is kind of meeting with everybody and their mother right now. They`ve had a ton of high profile witness this week and they`re planning to continue to do that next week. I`m curious as to whether this pace they`re operating at right now might mean that they are wrapping up or maybe they`re just being incredibly efficient.  Joining us now is Kyle Cheney who reports on Congress for politico.com.  Mr. Cheney, thank you for being with us. Appreciate your time.  KYLE CHENEY, CONGRESS REPORTER, POLITICO: Thanks for having me, Rachel.  MADDOW: Is there – am I right to sense that there has been an uptick in the pace, particularly in this House committee?  CHENEY: No question. And I mean, this committee if you remember back they were absolutely hobbled by partisanship for months in a bay people wondered if they would gate investigation off the ground at all. So, it`s not totally surprising that they`re suddenly – they righted that ship a little bit and having people in, but the notable intensification of that pace of bringing in witnesses and not just any witnesses but high-profile witnesses, people close to the president, people close to the campaign gives you a sense that they`re sort of reaching a climax or a crescendo here and maybe nearing the end which I think a lot of Republicans would be happy to hear.  MADDOW: I highlighted the story of Ike Kaveladze and his testimony this week a moment ago, in part because he seems like such an important and complex target given his ties to the Putin government and to money laundering on an epic scale, at least according to a government report.  Is there any sense that the pace of these witnesses might be impeding the ability of the committee to actually prepare to ask them hard questions?  CHENEY: Well, I think you`ve heard frustration from some Democrats of a sense they`re feeling rushed that maybe there`s pressure, political pressure or otherwise to get this thing done with. I don`t think – I mean, they met with Carter Page yesterday for seven hours. Just about seven hours and I think they`re getting ask the questions they want to ask in those windows of time that they`re inside the committee room. But can they synthesize everything and come to any concrete and satisfying solutions that aren`t partisan in nature? That`s the part that I think is frustrating some lawmakers right now, too.  MADDOW: Kyle Cheney, congressional reporter for Politico.com, Kyle, thank you for being with us particularly on a Friday night.  CHENEY: Great to be here.  MADDOW: Really appreciate it.  All right. We`ll be right back. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Lawrence O`Donnell is here tonight in uno minuto, buckled in, ready to go, don`t touch that dial. But I want to advise you on one thing first for your plans for earlier next week. I don`t know if you forgot and made other plans but Tuesday night is – election night. Election night all over the country with big marquee governor`s races in New Jersey and Virginia. You need to check now to see if you need to be voting where you live on Tuesday in any state or local elections. But then, make your plans for Tuesday night to watch all the returns.  Again, sit tight now. Here comes Lawrence, but plan ahead for Tuesday night. There`s going to be special live election night coverage all night Tuesday night right here. You need to cancel whatever else you were planning on doing it.  That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again on Monday.  Now, it`s time for  THE LAST WORD  with great Lawrence O`Donnell.  Good evening, Lawrence. RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts now, which I`m going to watch because I`m like what`s going on here. Good evening, Rachel.  RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: This is our long awaited night where we take calls from viewers on difficult gardening questions to the shoulder season. So, it`s a really been sludge year - HAYES: Good. But do not, don`t kill that, go with your gut on this.  MADDOW: I`m telling you, every week when Susan drops me off at work on Monday morning, she says, now, you let me know if you need consulting to do the gardening show.  HAYES: Well, tell Susan I said hello - MADDOW: I will do. We`re doing that tonight. Thanks, Chris.  HAYES: Thanks.  MADDOW: All right. Thanks to you at home for joining this hour.  So, as Chris was alluding to there, there`s a lot of to talk about right this second. I will tell you that there have been a whole bunch of scoops that have broken in the press today, this afternoon and now into tonight. This has been a Neiman lights day for a whole bunch of American journalists, for a conservative journalist in particular, for a  Wall Street Journal  journalist, somebody from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence made a whole bunch of news in his own right today. We`d just had some really, really, really interesting reporting out of the Eastern District of Virginia, which is the sleeper story, which I think is a huge deal. A whole bunch of important news has broken today. We`re going to be talking about all of those stories tonight.  But I have to tell you, CNN has reported in the last few minutes, citing two sources familiar with the matter, CNN is now reporting that the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation has produced its first criminal charges. Now, I would elaborate further right now on what CNN is reporting on this matter tonight, but that really is all they`re reporting.  This is not confirmed by NBC News. This is not confirmed by any other news organization at this point. So, this is just CNN`s work. They`re saying that a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. today approved the first charges in the investigation that`s being led by the special counsel, by Mueller.  Now, we don`t know what the charges are. The charges are reportedly sealed, under orders from a federal judge. Let`s find out what that means in just a moment. We also don`t know who the charges are against. If they`re against one person or multiple people, or who those people are if there are, in fact, charges against them.  Now, we also don`t have any reason to believe that anybody who might be charge if this report is accurate, we don`t have any reason to believe that any of those people have been notified of the fact that they have been charged, if, in fact, these charges are still under seal.  So, the headline is very provocative. We know very little detail beyond that. I mean, other than the fact prosecutors associated with the Mueller investigation were seen entering the room where the grand jury meets in D.C., in the federal courthouse in D.C. Other than the attorneys being spotted in that room, which has happened before, we have no corroborating information about whether or not this is true.  So, obviously, this is a very provocative prospect. We`re keeping an eye closely on that for additional reporting. Lots of news organizations are scrambling to do their own corroboration, their own approach to the story. I`ll tell you as somebody who has covered the Russia story and Russia investigation probably more extensively than anybody else in cable news, I -I`ll just tell you that there have been lots and lots and lots and lots of rumors that this was about to happen. And there have been lots of sort of credible, single source reports, unconfirmed single source reports that charges, in fact, were imminent from Mueller investigators.  But, you know, you follow all that stuff. You try to track all these things down, but until you`ve got multiple credible sources, it`s not reportable. CNN says it`s reportable at this point, nobody else does. If they`re right, this is the first reported multisource account that these charges may happen.  Now, on this story as in every story, there`s no reason to speculate further, especially with no further details to speculate on. But based on what they reported so far, how we should understand the significance of this if this story is proven out.  Joining us now is Barbara McQuade. She`s former U.S. attorney.  Ms. McQuade, thank you very much for having -for being here with us tonight. I have a lot of other things to talk to you about tonight as well, but I`m really glad you were here for this.  BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Oh, you bet. Happy to talk about all of it.  MADDOW: All right. So, we don`t know -again, NBC News has not confirmed the CNN reporting. But let me ask you about some of the terms that they`re describing, just as a law enforcement professional, as a former federal prosecutor, tell us what this means.  A federal grand jury in Washington D.C. approved the first charges in the investigation being led by Mueller. Tell us about the work of a grand jury and what it means to say that a grand jury has approved charges.  MCQUADE: Well, typically, what happens in a grand jury investigation is they hear evidence. It could be little case, where they hear it for one day, or a big case, like the one that we`ve been talking about here, where they hear testimony and see exhibits over a matter of months.  And then at some point, the prosecutor makes a decision to seek or decline to seek an indictment. They think they`ve gotten to the point where they`ve got probable cause and sufficient evidence to go forward. So, the prosecutor will draft the proposed indictment, present it to the grand jury, discuss the law and the elements of the offenses, answer any questions they have, and leave the room and leave the grand jury to deliberate among themselves and make a decision whether they approve or decline to approve -they call it issuing a true bill or issuing a no true bill. It sounds like if this report is accurate, they did issue a true bill.  MADDOW: Now, that`s at that point, not an adversarial process. There`s nobody making a presentation to the grand jury that they shouldn`t approve the proposed indictment from the prosecutor, right? This is between the prosecutor and the grand jury without any intervening -any intervention from somebody who might be representing the target of the proposed indictment?  MCQUADE: That`s right. And that`s why, you know, the defendant is still presumed innocent. They have not had a chance to cross-examine witnesses, confront accusers, or do all of the things they have a right to do at trial. It`s been very one sided and the standard is, not guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but simply probable cause.  But I will say this -you sometimes hear this complaint that a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich before a grand jury. I don`t think that`s true. Not the least of which it`s a strange metaphor but because there is an obligation under DOJ ethics rules to present the grand jury with significant exculpatory information so they are understanding the whole story.  MADDOW: Does Robert Mueller, over his years in law enforcement, in the Justice Department and the FBI, does he have a reputation in terms of how aggressive he might be about charging people? Is he known for approaching these things in any particular way?  MCQUADE: I`d say the one thing he`s known for is approaching investigations with a sense of urgency. I think we`re seeing that here, to have charges filed now. I mean, some people may not think that this is not very quick, it seems very quick to me. But it is his reputation to work very hard, to drive his people very hard, to leave no stone unturned.  And so, I think we`re seeing the fruits of that sort of effort tonight.  MADDOW: Now, according to CNN`s report, and this is not confirmed by NBC, in their language the charges are still sealed under orders of a federal judge. What would it mean for the grand jury, as you described, to have approved a proposed indictment but then for the charges to be sealed? How does that work and why is that done?  MCQUADE: Sealing is fairly common at this stage when you have an indictment that is issued -or approved as it was -may have been today. And the reason is that law enforcement kind of wants to get its ducks in a row before they go out and arrest the defendant or even notify them. It may be they don`t arrest whoever this defendant is because they worked out a relationship with his or her defense attorney to bring them in to appear on the case.  But, you know, it`s late on a Friday afternoon, they want to keep it secret so at a moment of their choosing, they can either inform the defendant that he or she has been charge, or they can surprise them with an arrest first thing Monday morning, Tuesday morning, whenever they choose to do it.  MADDOW: Can charges like this, an indictment like this, can it be sealed indefinitely? How long can a seal like this last?  MCQUADE: It can be sealed for some time. Sometimes there are strategic reasons to seal an indictment for longer period of times. You may want to arrest other people that you`re continuing to investigate, and you don`t want to alert them that someone else has been charged. It could be someone is a fugitive and you don`t know where they are, and so, you don`t want to alert them of the charges, in the meantime, while you look for them.  At some point, it is considered against the defendant`s speedy trial rights if you keep an indictment sealed for too long. And certainly there`s the five-year statue of limitations from the time the conduct was committed. So, it can be sealed forever. But my guess is in this case, they`re sealing for some period of time just so they can effectuate either an arrest plan or an appearance by the defendant in court.  MADDOW: Let me ask you an admittedly very damn question about this and I am not a lawyer. I have no law enforcement connections whatsoever, other than speeding tickets. But is it possible -I`m thinking about the treatment by the special counsel thus far of Paul Manafort in particular. The no-knock warrant to go turn up at his house in the pre-drawn hours, including picking the lock. And he first finds out that they`re there when they`re knocking at his bedroom door.  The reports that prosecutors working with special counsel Mueller told Paul Manafort expect to be indicted. We have no reason to think these charges, that they have anything to do with Manafort. But I`m just thinking about that form of aggression that they seemed to have taken at least to that one figure in the case.  Is it possible that you would bring a proposed indictment to a grand jury, you`d the grand jury approve it, you`d seal the indictment, and you would do that basically as a form of pressure on a target? Pressure on a suspect, not necessarily because the end game is to put that person in jail but you want to scare the bejesus out of that person so that they tell you something for a larger part of your investigation.  MCQUADE: That seems unlikely to me. I think even the examples that you gave were not so much scare tactics as necessary steps in the investigation. Telling someone they`re a target of the investigation just puts them on notice, that if you want to come in and cooperate, now is the time. Maybe you can talk us out of it, if you can provide us information.  The no-knock warrant, I think, you know, you have to show a judge that you`ve got a reason for that. There was some legitimate concern, if that report is true, that maybe evidence would be destroyed, you know, deleting of a document that`s saved on a cell phone, for example, that would be done in a few minutes it takes for a knock and answer of a door. So, I don`t think so. I think it seems unlikely that they would file an indictment under seal just to scare somebody.  I think they mean business. I think if there`s an indictment, they`re going to show it to somebody. I think they probably will use it as leverage in hopes of getting cooperation against more egregious offenders. But I guess it remains to be seen who the defendant or defendants are in this case.  MADDOW: Barbara, let me just ask you one last question here and I`m going to ask you to stay with us for the hour and come back and talk to us about these things in a moment, but before I let you go for now, you did mention that you feel like just in your -in your opinion, this feels quick to you? This feels like this might have been faster than you were expecting there to be charges and an indictment in this case. Can I just ask why you said that?  MCQUADE: It seems like such a complex case, you know, when you think about the big picture, about any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, seems like such an enormous case that it could take many, many months to get to the bottom of it. But even in if it`s a charge against Manafort or Flynn or someone else, it seems there`s so much new news all the time with such complex financial issues that it seems it would take a team of lawyers a very long time to get to the bottom of it.  But as I said, Robert Mueller does have a reputation for working with urgency and he`s got a team of 16 really topnotch prosecutors so I`m sure they`ve been working days, nights and weekends to get this done.  MADDOW: Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney, thank you very much. And again, I`d love for you to stick with us for the hour.  MCQUADE: You bet.  MADDOW: I have a feeling we`ve got a lot more to talk about.  I want to bring in the conversation now, Matthew Miller. He`s the former spokesperson for the Justice Department.  Mr. Miller, thank you for being here tonight. I appreciate it.  MATTHEW MILLER, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Thank you.  MADDOW: So, you heard that discussion that I just had with Barbara McQuade. You`ve seen this reporting that`s come out. Again, I need to -I need to underscore that NBC News has not confirmed this reporting tonight and as of five seconds ago when I last checked with the control room, no other news agency has as well.  This is CNN`s reporting alone. They say they`re citing two sources familiar with the matter and they`re saying that the first charges have been brought. They`ve been brought. They`re under seal and so we don`t know what they are.  Let me ask your top line response to that news if this turns out to be the case.  MILLER: I think what Barbara McQuade said is accurate. This shows that Bob Mueller is moving very quickly. And he`s known for moving quickly, but, you know, there are a lot of people that thought he might pursue this entire investigation over months, into next year at some point, and then wrap this all up at one time, with a series of charges, maybe a report to Congress about actions by the president that wouldn`t result in criminal charges.  And it appears, if this report is accurate, that he`s decided not to take that course of action, but to bring, at least one indictment, maybe more another maybe more than one set of indictments early in this case while he continues to investigate other things. And I think that`s important to note.  This does not mean, obviously, that we are at the end of this investigation. I think this is the first indictment, maybe set of indictments, we`ll see when the charges are unsealed. And there could be more to come.  MADDOW: Matt, from a DOJ perspective, part of the reporting that CNN has done tonight which is more background rather than it is sort of some new fact that they`ve dug up. But the way they`re characterizing their report tonight is that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who`s overseeing all matters related to the Russia investigation because of the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Rod Rosenstein, as the person overseeing the Mueller investigation, would he have had to see this proposed indictment? Would he have had to have been informed about these proposed charges in order for the Mueller investigation to have gone this far?  MILLER: You know, technically, under the regulations, he wouldn`t have to see the indictment. It would really be up to the relationship that he and Mueller worked out under the terms of the appointment. The appointment document itself is very narrow about what -you know, it kind of sets out the things Mueller can investigate, it doesn`t set out the relationship he and the deputy attorney general would have.  I would have expected Mueller would have informed Rosenstein about this, would have briefed him about who he plans to indict, when he plans to do it. But I -you know, I don`t know if he would brief him on the actual -you know, what he`s actually found. I think, especially given the real concerns that people have raised about Rosenstein`s independence, Mueller will be aware of those and I think he might be careful about how much detail he actually does share with the deputy attorney general.  MADDOW: Matt, on the issue of the political opposition that the Mueller investigation and that the congressional Russia investigations have run into, one of the things that`s been discussed over the last few days is whether the Mueller budget request, whether the actual funding, that needs to go in some ways go through Congress in order to keep the Mueller investigation going, whether that might be a point of leverage that Republicans in the White House could use against the Mueller investigation and given the timing of when that investigation started, when he was put in charge of this probe, which was just about six months ago, maybe that question was starting to come due.  Do that -I want to know what your reaction is to that recent reporting and those concerns by people who were worried about the independence of the investigation.  MILLER: You know, look, I think it`s clear that everyone from the president to his allies in Congress to the conservative media have been orchestrating a kind of escalating drum beat against the special counsel, and that includes raising questions about his budget, includes raising questions about whether he ought to be fired. And I think that shows nervousness on their part about where his investigation might go, who he charge, what he might find, and what changes now.  If indictments are unsealed next week, it means you`re interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation, but you`re interfering what investigation that a grand jury has found probable causes to charge someone criminally. It becomes a question of really -it`s obviously not obstruction of justice for Congress to do that, but it becomes, you know, blocking an investigation that as borne fruit. It becomes a more questionable activity after he`s filed charges than it was before.  MADDOW: One last question for you, Matt. One of the stories that we were planning on leading with tonight before this news broke was the interesting and unexpected news out of the eastern district of Virginia, that the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Dana Boente, who has played a number of stand in roles, being brought on as acting attorney general, acting deputy attorney general, he`s now the acting assistant attorney general on national security matters, he announced his resignation today. And that may be a totally separate matter from this, it may be absolutely unrelated.  There has been some speculation that Dave Boente, because of the job he had in the Trump administration, particularly being the person at DOJ who James Comey was reporting to during that contested time that James Comey has said the president was really pressuring him on the Russia investigation, there`s been some reporting, some speculation that maybe Dana Boente may end up being a witness in part of this investigation, maybe that has something to do with him stepping down today.  Do you have any thoughts on that matter?  MILLER: You know, I don`t know if it`s true he`ll be a witness. I do know -I talked to someone today that said they talked to Dana as recently as several days ago, and all he can talk about was how eager he was for his successor at the national security division where he`s been acting assistant attorney general right now to be confirmed so he could retake his job in the eastern district of Virginia. What that says to me is he did not decide two days after having that conversation to resign, but that he was forced out by the Trump administration.  We don`t know the answer to that, obviously. We don`t know whether it has anything to do with the Mueller investigation, but the timing has been curious with his sudden departure from the department.  MADDOW: Just to underscore what you just said there, that was a conversation he had a couple of days ago in which he did not express any desire and, in fact, expressed enthusiasm about continuing in the Eastern District of Virginia and today mysteriously, or at least surprisingly, he resigned.  MILLER: Yes, exactly right. I think you can draw from that, it wasn`t a resignation that wasn`t of his own volition.  MADDOW: Fascinating, and an important piece of this news. Matthew Miller former DOJ spokesperson, thank you for being with us on short notice tonight, Matt. I really appreciate it.  MILLER: Thank you.  MADDOW: I want to bring into the conversation now, another former U.S. attorney, Paul Fishman who until very recently was the U.S. attorney representing the great state of New Jersey.  Mr. Fishman, thank you very much for joining us on short notice.  PAUL FISHMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY (via telephone): Thanks for having me back, Rachel.  MADDOW: Let me underscore again this is news that has not been confirmed by NBC. This is one news organization reporting that charges, the first criminal charges have been filed in the Mueller investigation. We don`t know what those charges are. They`re reportedly still sealed, under orders from a federal judge.  This is unconfirmed news, but this is CNN`s reporting tonight. Mr. Fishman, I know you`re familiar with what CNN is reporting. Let me ask your top line response to it?  FISHMAN: So, obviously, Rachel, when we talk about this investigation, it`s not just one investigation. There are multiple parts and lots of moving pieces to it. There`s the Manafort piece, the Flynn piece, the potential obstruction of justice, the collusion with the Russians.  And it looks from the team that Bob Mueller has assembled that he`s got multiple groups of lawyers working on different parts of the investigation, and that would make sense. It`s a great way to organize the operation. And it seems like that one particular piece of that investigation has now gotten to a place where Mueller is comfortable returning charges against at least one person if CNN`s reporting is correct.  That doesn`t mean that they`re finished. It doesn`t mean that that`s -those will be all charges against even that individual, but he`s obviously gotten to a place, if the reports are true, where he`s comfortable asking a grand jury to indict, knowing he shouldn`t or wouldn`t do that unless he has sufficient evidence to convict.  MADDOW: And in terms of how this is being handled, again, if the CNN reporting is accurate, if the charges are sealed, CNN reports plans were prepared today for anybody charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday. We just got an explanation from Barbara McQuade, your former colleague in Michigan, about what it means for a judge to have sealed these charges.  What is your take on the decision to seal them? The possibility they`d be unsealed on Monday? And the question of whether or not attorneys for the targets of this reported indictment will be notified?  FISHMAN: Well, so I think all of those things are possible. Typically, when an indictment is returned, what it means is the majority of the grand jury has voted that the person should be charged and then the indictment is presented to a judge and then it`s filed on the docket of the court. If the prosecutors, the federal prosecutors, believe there was a reason to seal the indictment right away, they can ask the judge to do that until certain things happen.  There`s always a reason that the prosecutors would give to the judge. Sometimes, as Barb said earlier on your show, it`s because they want the element of surprise for the arrest, sometimes it`s because the investigation is continuing, and they don`t want to unseal at the moment. Sometimes, it`s because they haven`t had a chance to tell the lawyer for the person or people who are getting indicted and because they`ve been having a dialogue over some period of weeks or months, they think out of fairness, they would like the opportunity to do that before it becomes a matter of public record.  MADDOW: In terms of the question I also asked Barbara McQuade, is it possible that these are charges that are going to remain sealed for a long time? That this is something being used as leverage against somebody in this investigation who is maybe a smaller fish who they`re trying to pressure into talking about stuff they haven`t previously been willing to talk these investigators about? Is an indictment, a sealed indictment used that way?  FISHMAN: So, sometimes it can be used that way. It`s not typical, I think. What is -in my experience, what typical happens is when somebody like Bob Mueller gets to a place he`s ready to indict, a conversation would ensue between him or between somebody on his staff, and the lawyers or lawyers representing the target of the investigation, saying we`re ready to go, here`s a copy of the indictment. It`s time to actually come to the table and, if your guy is going to come to the table and talk.  And that happens or it doesn`t happen. Typically, though, if the person says, no, indict me, then that`s what happens. And then the person will be arrested or will be given an opportunity to voluntarily appear in the courtroom, to answer the charges and enter a plea of not guilty. And so, what we don`t know is whether on Monday and we`ll see on Monday. We`ll have a lot more information then, if the story is true. It`s possible someone could be arrested over the weekend or Monday morning.  It`s possible that on Monday, Bob Mueller or somebody could have a press conference announcing the indictment and the person`s appearance will follow by some number of days. We just don`t know. It`s too early to tell.  MADDOW: One last kind of dumb question for you. If there are people who know they might potentially be indicted in this investigation and they just heard that there`s a sealed indictment, is it possible people could like flee the country this weekend?  FISHMAN: I -my guess is if Bob Mueller and his team of prosecutors and agents had any fear that anybody was going to flee this weekend, they probably have -they probably would have taken them into custody either today or over the weekend to prevent that possibility. I think that`s unlikely under a circumstance like this, particularly when people have known for a while their conduct has been examined.  MADDOW: Paul Fishman, former U.S. attorney from the great state of New Jersey, Mr. Fishman, thank you for joining us on short notice. Really appreciate it.  FISHMAN: Thanks for having me back.  MADDOW: All right. So, again, this is news that is not confirmed by NBC News or by any other news organization, but CNN is reporting that the first charges have been filed in the special counsel investigation being led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller. As you know, that Mueller-led investigation started six months ago, the overall FBI investigation reportedly started a year ago. Mueller`s remit is to look at the Russian attack on the presidential election and the question of whether or not anybody associated with the Trump campaign was in cahoots with that attack.  We don`t know what the charges are, if there are in fact charges. They`re being described as sealed charges that we may find out about on Monday if they`re unsealed on that day. So, somebody can be taken.  Again, unconfirmed reports in terms of NBC News. This is CNN`s reporting as of right now. We`ll stay on it. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Always happens on a Friday. We`re following some breaking news tonight.  According to CNN, the investigation being led by special counsel Robert Mueller has issued its first criminal charges. Now, these charges are reportedly under seal and we do not yet know what those charges are, or who may being charged, we don`t know if this report is accurate. NBC News has not confirmed this reporting yet, but we will update you if an when we get any more details on that front, either confirming or denying that CNN reporting.  But I got to tell you, this has been a wild day of scoops broken by reporters across the country. Let me start with Rebecca Ballhaus at  The Wall Street Journal .  Rebecca Ballhaus has got a scoop today that I believe may end up being one of the more important stories about the Russia scandal overall. It`s about a crucial time when we first became aware as Americans that Russia was doing something in the election. The first report that we as a country had about that was on June 14th last year.  Ellen Nakashima in  The Washington Post,  last summer, that headline from her, Russian government hackers penetrated DNC. That was the first indication we had as a country that something was up in our election that specifically had to do with the Russian government. Now, the date of that first public report ends up being really important. That was June 14th last year.  Now, keeping that in mind, there was some interesting reporting earlier this week from Rebecca Ballhaus at  The Wall Street Journal  among others, that was about the data firm Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica is now famous as the data firm that worked for the Trump campaign, right?  But Rebecca Ballhaus at  The Journal  was first to report this week that investigators have seen an e-mail in which the head of Cambridge Analytica says that last June, June 2016, he made an on overture to WikiLeaks. He offered that Cambridge Analytica, his firm, would like to help WikiLeaks, disseminate all of those thousands of documents that had been stolen from Democrats during the campaign. Cambridge Analytica specifically offered to index the stolen Democratic emails and documents to make them online searchable so there could be, you know, more stories written about them so they could spread further.  Now, that offer from Cambridge Analytica to WikiLeaks that`s potentially very important, right? If you`re looking for concrete evidence of the Trump campaign helping out in the Russian plot to interfere in our election, in a way that would harm the chances of Clinton winning that election, well, that looks like a big deal, right? Here`s the Trump campaign data firm offering to literally help more efficiently distribute the Democratic documents that the Russians had stolen. That`s potentially huge, right?  But here`s the problem with that. Here`s the reason the Cambridge Analytica thing didn`t ring everybody`s bell this week. If that offer from Cambridge Analytica went to WikiLeaks in June of last year, the first important thing to know about that is that in June of last year, Cambridge Analytica didn`t work for the Trump campaign. They didn`t start working for the Trump campaign until the following month, in July.  Also, though, again about that timing. We don`t know exactly when in June that overture was made from Cambridge Analytica to WikiLeaks, and because of that, we also can`t assume that Cambridge Analytica knew the stolen Democratic e-mails they were offering to help distribute, we can`t assume they knew that those Democratic e-mails had been stolen by the Russian government, right?  The first public reporting of that was June 14th. If Cambridge Analytica made this overture to WikiLeaks before June 14th, maybe they had no idea what they were proposing to do was weaponize and further spread documents that were literally stolen by Russian military intelligence. Maybe they didn`t know. Maybe had they known that, they would have been horrified.  Now if their overtures to WikiLeaks happened after June 14th, after it became public knowledge that those documents weren`t just stolen by rondos, they were stolen by the Russian government, well, that would be a different story, right? That would be an interesting thing to figure out if that`s the case.  Is the overture before or after June 14th, before or after you knew those things were stolen by the Russian government, right? That question puts a spotlight on Cambridge Analytica. They should probably explain the specifics of that timeline so we know exactly what they though they were doing in making that overture and whether they knew they were offering to help a Russia intelligence operations.  So, I mean, there`s definitely more reporting to do there. That`s an important interesting part of this. But even if it turns out that the worst is true about Cambridge Analytica here, it remains the fact they weren`t working for the Trump campaign at the time that overture happened, so that still doesn`t implicate the Trump campaign in part of what might be Russian collusion.  If you`re looking to implicate the Trump campaign in Russia collusion, for that, you had to wait for Rebecca Ballhaus` scoop that came out tonight.  OK, remember the -there goes my pencil. All right. Remember that date again, right, that specific date when we the public first learned that the Democratic documents that were stolen weren`t randomly taken by some thief, they were taken as part of a Russian intelligence operation. That news first broke June 14th, last year. When that news broke on June 14th, it was not a subtle thing. It was everywhere, right?  This was that initial report, Russian government hackers penetrated DNC. That started a litany, a torrent of reporting about that. Cyber researchers confirmed Russian government hack of DNC, U.S. officials say little doubt Russia behind DNC hack. Russia is behind email release. Spy agency consensus grows that Russia hacks DNC. Security experts say Russia probably hacked the Democrats. FBI investigating possible Russian connection to the leaked DNC e-mails.  I mean, it was everywhere. And you know what? Even if you can`t read and all you do is sometimes watch the TV news, no matter what kind of TV news you were watching, you couldn`t help being exposed to this story, even if the only TV news you watch is on FOX.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From the campaign trail,  The Washington Post  reporting the Russian government hacked into the computer network of the Democratic National Committee.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were able to access all e-mails going in and out of the DNC since last summer. So, these hackers, and apparently the Russian government, now have inside information into the Democrat strategy for 2016.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`re tracking another major story case, a case of cyber espionage targeting the Democratic Party. U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian cyber spies hacked into the computers belonging to the Democratic National Committee.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a clear espionage attempt by the Russian government to steal information about the U.S. political process.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The clues point to two Russian intelligence agencies.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A bizarre story now from where cyber space meets the campaign trail.  The Washington Post  reports the Russian government hacked into the computer network of the Democratic National Committee.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three private security firms concluded that the hackers are Russian. Some security experts say Russian intelligence could be behind the attacks with the goal of interfering in the election. Documents taken in the hacks have been showing up on line.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Several American cyber security experts told NBC Russia`s goal in leaking the e-mails through WikiLeaks was to sow chaos in American politics and help Donald Trump win the presidency.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are trying to give Trump an indirect edge, or an indirect weight by which they can help him accomplish his goals.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cyber experts say the DNC was hacked by the cyber units of both Russian military intelligence and new KGB, nicknamed Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. They used signature IP addresses and malware associated with Russian state actors.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The New York Times  reports on the growing FBI investigation into the Democratic National Committee email hack. Secretary of State John Kerry this morning raised the issue with Russia`s foreign minister.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MADDOW: That was what the news was like last summer after  The Washington Post  first broke the news that the Russian government was behind the stealing and hacking of e-mails and documents out of the Democratic Party. Now, there was a lot of news like that. It was not subtle.  If you were contacting WikiLeaks and offering to help in this operation in early June, before any of that reporting started, it`s possible you might not have known this was pretty well understood to be a Russian intelligence operation that WikiLeaks was helping with. But once mid-June hit, this was not a story hiding its light under the bushel, right? This story was everywhere. Even if you didn`t pay attention to the news, by July 25th, Trump himself was joking about Russia leaking the DNC e-mails, quote, because Putin likes me.  By July 27th, he was making his stone-faced, nobody laugh joke, hey, Russia, if you`re listening, go get more Clinton e-mails.  This is a subject of wide, wide discussion in the regular media, in the conservative media, on the campaign, by the candidates. It was a matter of widely reported international diplomacy between the United States and Russia. From starting in mid June and through the end of June into July, into August, it was no secret that Russia, the Russian government, hacked the Democrats e-mails.  Well, tonight, Rebecca Ballhaus of  The Wall Street Journal  reports that on August 26th, so well after the Russian involvement was widely known, Rebekah Mercer, major Trump donor, founder of Cambridge Analytica and  Breitbart  and everything else in the pro-Trump media universe, Rebekah Mercer and her billionaire family, the single largest financers of the Trump campaign, full stop, on August 26th, she directed Cambridge Analytica to help WikiLeaks distribute the Democratic e-mails that by then everybody knew had been be stolen by the Russian government.  And, yes, we know from reporting this week that Cambridge Analytica had that idea on their own a couple months earlier, but she directed them to do it once we all knew those WikiLeaks documents were part of a Russian intelligence operation. And she directed Cambridge Analytica to help with that once the Mercer family was very much a part of the Trump campaign.  And that means, bottom line, the major funder of the Trump campaign, appears to have knowingly tried to help out with the Russian government hack of Democratic documents, to better weaponize them to Trump`s benefit in the presidential campaign. So, that`s a serious scoop from Rebecca Ballhaus at  The Wall Street Journal .  Then later tonight, we got another one. Conservative reporter Byron York got a scoop tonight about the Republican funder behind Fusion GPS, which is the research firm that produced the Christopher Steele dossier on Trump and Russia. We`d actually known since October of last year, since before the election, that the research firm that commission the dossier of alleged Russian dirt on Trump, we knew they`d been initially funded by a Republican who was opposed to Trump in the Republican primary, then after Trump got the nomination, Fusion GPS instead got a Democratic donor to keep funding their work, the Democratic funder in support of Clinton against Trump in the general election. We knew that already, we really did know that from the beginning, from David Corn`s first initial report on Halloween night last year.  Now, we learned earlier this week, no surprise, that the Democratic funder of the latter part of the Fusion GPS research was, in fact, a Democratic funder in support of Clinton. It was a law firm connected to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.  Well, tonight, Byron York is first to report that the initial funder was `The Washington Free Beacon . Huh? It`s a conservative website. It`s kind of like  The Washington Times  or  The Daily Caller , the Glenn Beck thing. It`s like one of these flurry of Republican web publications that started up in D.C. in the past few years.  And, honestly, no snark intended here at all, serious credit to Byron York for getting this. Even before he got this scoop tonight, Byron York had done really good work on this story. He interviewed tons of Republican operatives and even Republican candidates who had opposed Trump during the primary. He got lots of them on the record about not being the Republican funder.  But after having done the leg work tonight, he was rightfully first to report who was that funder. So, kudos to him for the scoop. Now we know.  Now, on that Trump dossier, whether or not you care who funded it, I think it`s also flown a little bit under the radar in the last 24 hours that the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, right, so we have the Director of National Intelligence, that`s an office. The guy who`s the top lawyer there.  He has come out and declared in very blunt terms that when the intelligence community put out its assessment that, yes, Russia did attack our election, they didn`t rely on the dossier to produce that report. They didn`t even use the dossier to produce that conclusion. Robert Litt was the top lawyer in the office of the director of national intelligence under the Obama administration when that assessment came out, he`s in a position to know. He says the DNI and the intelligence community, they came to their conclusions about the Russian involvement in the election based, quote, entirely on other sources and analysis. They did not use the dossier.  So, that ends up being important for the political maneuvering that`s going on right now in Washington. The White House is trying to use this report as who funded Fusion GPS as a way of saying the whole story of Russia interfering in the election is some kind of hoax. The logic is a little thin in that claim anyway. But among this fireworks show of scoops we`ve had in the past 24 hours, is this news that the intelligence community came to its conclusions about what the Russians did in our election with no reference to the dossier whatsoever?  So, naturally, the intelligence community must also be denounced and discredited, it`s terrible, for having found a true thing.  So in all that new breaking over the last 24 hours, all through today, all through this afternoon into tonight, there is one other scoop that broke today that I actually think is the most interesting, especially given the late night breaking news from CNN about Robert Mueller reportedly issuing the first charges in his investigation, the thing that I think is the most compelling, mysterious and, oh my God, I want to figure it out story of the day is next. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Do you recognize this man? Doesn`t really ring a bell, right? We did put his name up there which helps. Without the name, I probably couldn`t pick him out of a lineup. Do you recognize his name, though, right? It`s pronounced Boente, B-O-E-N-T-E.  In 2013, he became the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. President Obama officially appointed him in 2015. The Eastern District of Virginia is really powerful prosecutor`s office. It`s right outside Washington, D.C. They often end up doing really important terrorism and national security cases. So, Dana Boente was President Obama`s choice for that very important U.S. attorney`s job starting in 2013.  But then in the Trump era, Dana Boente became everything. He got all the jobs all at once. It was a weird thing for somebody who nobody had really ever heard of before. I mean, if you`re in law enforcement circles you`ve heard of the guy, right? But outside of law enforcement circles, why did Dana Boente start getting every job?  I mean, within the first two weeks of President Trump being in office, you may recall that he fired Sally Yates. She was the acting attorney general. She famously had personally come to the White House to warn them that national security advisor Mike Flynn was compromised by the Russians whereupon they didn`t respond for 18 days.  She wrote a memo explaining that the Trump Muslim ban was likely to be found unconstitutional in court. Trump fired her because of that January 30. When he fired Sally Yates, he needed somebody else to come in right away and become the new acting attorney general, and he chose Dana Boente who was still onboard in the Eastern District of Virginia. Dana Boente became the acting attorney general of the United States.  He served in that role until Jeff Sessions was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in ten days later on February 9th. So at that point, Dana Boente is no longer acting attorney general. At that point, he became the acting deputy attorney general. Deputy attorney general is the person who really runs the Justice Department on a day-to-day basis. He went from being acting A.G. to acting deputy A.G. once Sessions got there. He served as acting deputy attorney general until Rod Rosenstein got confirmed by the Senate to be the confirmed deputy attorney general as of late April.  Now, you might remember in the meantime, President Trump decided to fire all the U.S. attorneys all over the country. Boom no warning. Get out. Be gone by midnight. When it came time to actually do the firing, I think, I think it was Dana Boente as the acting attorney general who actually got on the phone and did the firing of those prosecutors.  But then Rod Rosenstein came on, and then became the confirmed deputy A.G., and then Dana Boente got another role. He became acting assistant attorney general for national security, which means he runs the national security division of the Justice Department. That`s a very big deal as well. And yes, in addition to all of that, he stayed on as the U.S. attorney in the eastern district of Virginia.  So, the guy had five jobs. That is, you know, that`s a lot. Even just the Eastern District of Virginia is a busy, big, important national security prosecutor`s office even in normal times.  At these times, though, in the Eastern District of Virginia, in addition to all of the other jobs he was dealing with at main Justice, in the eastern district of Virginia, it was Dana Boente`s office from which we saw the subpoenas related to Paul Manafort. It was Dana Boente`s office from which we saw the subpoenas related to Mike Flynn. It was Dana Boente`s office that has been handling the investigation into WikiLeaks and potentially charges associated with WikiLeaks, and Dana Boente`s office, right, the eastern district of Virginia, that`s where special counsel Robert Mueller first started using a grand jury.  So, this dude is like right in the middle of everything. And today, he quit.  Now, I don`t know what that`s about. We`re about to talk to somebody I hope who might know, but here`s one last really important point to what he`s been involved in, right? So, he had the jobs and running this crucial eastern of Virginia district job, right.  Special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly looking into whether President Trump obstructed when he fired the FBI Director James Comey. James Comey has testified to Congress under oath, that the president contacted him inappropriately, multiple times, to put pressure on him about the Russia investigation before he fired him.  According to James Comey, one of the witnesses to those inappropriate overtures by the president was Dana Boente.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: After April 11th, did he ask you more, ever, about the Russia investigation? Did he ask you any questions?  JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: We never spoke again after April 11th.  FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?  COMEY: It was kind of slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him we`re not going to do that, that I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general, Mr. Boente.  SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO), INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: After that discussion, did you take phone calls from the president?  COMEY: Yes, sir.  BLUNT: So, why did you just say you need to talk -why didn`t you say, I`m not taking that call? You need to talk to the attorney general?  COMEY: Well, I did on the April 11th call and reported the calls, the March 30th call and April 11th call to my superior who was the acting deputy attorney general.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MADDOW: The acting deputy attorney general at the time was Dana Boente who today just quit. Maybe he quit because he`s tired of being central to everything. He`s exhausted from playing every instrument in the band. Maybe that`s just tiring.  Is it possible he had to quit because he`s maybe going to have to be a witness if somebody brings charges against the president on the obstruction of justice matter?  Former DOJ spokesman Matt Miller just reported on our air moments ago that as recently as a few days ago, Dana Boente told a friend that he was really looking forward to handing off control of the national security division at main Justice so he could get back to work as U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. That was two days ago reportedly. But then suddenly, today, he quit as U.S. attorney.  We don`t know why that is. We are trying to figure it out. We are literally actively trying right now as I speak to figure that out.  Joining us again is Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney.  Barbara, I want to ask you, given your understanding of Dana Boente`s role, not just as a U.S. attorney in Eastern District of Virginia, but this interesting roles that he`s played in the Trump administration thus far, what do you make of his resignation today?  MCQUADE: Well, I was very surprised to see it. In fact, you know, he sort of like Rod Rosenstein, someone that I take great comfort in knowing he is there, actually. He is a career prosecutor who`s worked through Republican and Democratic administrations and I think cares about the institution and so, his departure concerns and alarms me a little bit and I don`t know the reason.  MADDOW: Is he actually the person who was called on to tell people to resign -to fire you and all the other U.S. attorneys?  MCQUADE: Yes. I got a call from Dana. You know, they announced it publicly at about 3:00 p.m. and then began making phone calls to each of us. And, you know, we`re all in contact and e-mails each other and I heard from people in alphabetical order that they`ve gotten their call from Dana, and as I getting close to the  Ms  my phone rings and I see it`s Dana and I take the call, I said is this my grim reaper call and he said I`m afraid it is.  But, you know, he was professional about the whole thing. I commented to a colleague that I was disappointed that Dana didn`t push back about the decision to fire all so abruptly, and my colleague pointed out that we don`t know that he didn`t. So, I always had great respect for him and sorry to see him go.  MADDOW: Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney, thank you for being with us tonight, Barbara. I really appreciate it. Thanks.  MCQUADE: Thanks, Rachel.  MADDOW: We`ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: So the big news we have been following tonight is a report of CNN that the first charges have been filed in special counsel Robert Mueller`s investigation. We don`t know what those charges are, if they exist, who has been charged. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting tonight. But we do have some exclusive news on the Mueller investigation that could prove relevant, particularly if that news about charging does bear out.   Reuters  yesterday reported a kind of bonkers story about the former CIA Director James Woolsey, who is a member of Trump campaign, adviser to Trump during the transition. You might remember, this spring, James Woolsey told  The Wall Street Journal  that he`d been present at a meeting during the campaign with several Turkish officials and Mike Flynn. Flynn was then national security adviser to the Trump campaign. He was also secretly on the payroll of the Turkish government.  At this meeting, James Woolsey said there was a fulsome, serious, unnerving discussion about kidnapping a dude in the United States and shipping him off to Turkey in the dead of night. James Woolsey was apparently unnerved by that meeting, among other things because doing stuff like that is illegal.  But now,  Reuters  reports that James Woolsey himself, the very next day after that meeting, he had his own meeting with the Turkish businessman who was paying Mike Flynn, and according to  Reuters , Woolsey offered his own services to the Turks for $10 million to mount a lobbying and PR campaign to discredit the same guy that Mike Flynn apparently discussed kidnapping.  Now, according to - Reuters  says that Woolsey -spokesman for Woolsey tells  Reuters  that Woolsey has no recollection of this proposing this $10 million deal. But what he did say is that the people who funded Mike Flynn, they`re trying to smear Jim Woolsey.  Look at this quote from the spokesman. Quote: With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it`s not a surprise others attempt to accomplish in the press what they can`t in the grand jury room.  So, this story about Woolsey wanting $10 million to -from the Turks to -this story`s coming out right now because everybody else is about to be indicted and turning on each other, right? Interesting theory.  We reached out to Jim Woolsey spokesman today. And we asked them to expand on those comments. Mr. Woolsey spokesman gave us this statement which is exclusive to us and NBC News.  Quote: Ambassador Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI regarding these September meeting, Ambassador Woolsey was invited to attend by one of General Flynn`s business partners. Ambassador Woolsey and his wife have responded to every request whether from the FBI or recently from the Office of the Special Counsel. It`s unfortunate yet predictable that in an effort to defend themselves, certain individuals have attempted to impugn the Woolseys` integrity.  Now, this is the first we have learned that special counsel Robert Mueller has been in communication with and has made requests of the former CIA Director James Woolsey who says he was at this crazy meeting with Turkish officials and Mike Flynn, while Mike Flynn was a Trump campaign adviser and secretly on Turkey`s payroll. Woolsey went public about that meeting in March. Since then, he`s been in communication with the FBI and with the Mueller investigation.  And now, according to him, the people who had Mike Flynn on their payroll, they`re shopping this story to make James Woolsey look bad. And we don`t know why. These are very intriguing allegations from people we understand very little about.  Why is this happening? Why now? And is there any connection to this reporting tonight from CNN that Mueller has actually filed the first charges in his investigation? We don`t know but it`s going to be a fun weekend figuring this stuff out, right? That does it for us tonight. We will see you again on Monday. Now, it`s time for  THE LAST WORD.  Joy Reid filling in for Lawrence tonight. Good evening, Joy.  "]

In fact, it has been debunked repeatedly and will continue to be debunked.I'm not surprised, but I think the real story is how nervous they are about these continuing investigations.REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: Last Congress in and the oversight committee wanted to investigate the Foundation and all the other payments involving the Clintons, and we were not allowed to do that by the leadership of the House for whatever reason. Now I think that this information is so explosive that there is no way you can justify not getting all the information on this.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It seems like the investigation into Russia efforts in 2016 may have taken a turn, or at least the tone has changed, this as some new revelations about a Democrat lobbyist, Tony Podesta, who is the brother of John Podesta, who of course was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, an investigation into what he did or his company did in relation to Ukraine. It has morphed into, we are told, a criminal inquiry into whether the firm violated the foreign agents registration act, and the tie to Paul Manafort, the one-time campaign manager of the Trump campaign.NBC News had the original story. Mueller now investigating Democrat lobbyist Tony Podesta. The Podesta Group issued a statement saying the firm is cooperating fully with the special counsel's office and has taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms timely compliance in all of our client engagements. The Podesta Group conducts due diligence and consults with appropriate legal experts to ensure compliance and disclosure regulations at all times. We did so in this case.So we know that there is more to this investigation. Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent of The Washington Examiner; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post. OK, Byron, you wrote a column about this. Is there a sense up on Capitol Hill that this is turning a bit?BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I think the change in tone we are seeing among these committees that are investigating this, this is not the Mueller investigation but the Congressional investigation, is I think we are hearing more about Russia and less about collusion. If you look at public statements of the people who are running this thing, they are talking more about the active measures Russia took, like the Facebook ads. These are indisputable things that we know about. And from what I've heard, talking to a number of people involved in this, they just don't seem to have the evidence that's pointing them toward collusion.And then when you get something like the uranium deal, that takes it further from the whole collusion idea, which used to be the heart of the investigation.BAIER: Right. The president obviously tweeting about this. Officials behind the now dossier plead the fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it. This dossier and this group Fusion GPS are coming under a lot of scrutiny.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. RICHARD BURR, R-N.C.: As it relates to the Steele Dossier, unfortunately the committee has hit a wall. The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources?SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARK.: This outfit here in Washington D.C., Fusion GPS, has gone to the greatest lengths possible to try to conceal who paid them. It makes me think it was probably a Democratic political operative or a Russian intelligence service.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: Mollie?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: This is very different than the narrative we had for a long time. One of the people there just mentioned we don't know how they got their information. But we do know that they did pay some sources for their information in Russia. That's what led Obama's former CIA director Mike Morell to say he didn't trust this dossier.But originally this was the entire basis of the Trump-collusion narrative, that this dossier suggested that there was something very nefarious going on, and this was used to undermine the incoming administration. It coordinated with all these leaks we were getting about Michael Flynn having a conversation with a Russian or Jeff Sessions having a conversation with a Russian or Jim Comey did this briefing which pretty quickly made it to the media.And now we have this totally different story which is Fusion GPS was actually getting funded or working on behalf of Russians to undermine sanction efforts against Russian oligarchs and Putin cronies and whatnot while doing this dossier. This is just a dramatically different story than we have been getting and requires a lot more of those great investigative journalism things we've been seeing on the Trump thing. We'd like to see some more on Fusion GPS.BAIER: It's important to have a caveat that we don't know what we don't know about the special counsel's investigation. And we are reading the tea leaves in some of what's coming out in leaks. Obviously there hasn't been a major leak of some collusion tie. But these investigations continue.CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think just stepping back a minute, the fact that they are following up some sort of lead on a foreign agent registration possible violation by a Democratic firm suggests Robert Mueller is a straight shooter and not a partisan figure as he has been accused of being. I think that piece of the narrative should be adjusted as well.Just on the surface it doesn't seem like the crime of the century that they are running down on Tony Podesta, a failure to register when it seemed like he was working some kind of subcontractor to Manafort on a still murky episode. But I do think, again, stepping back and looking at the big, big picture that we're getting here, maybe collusion is receding, but there was a lot of Russian activity in America over the last few years. And yes, there was this purchase of the uranium stockpile which remains to be explained. There's the penetration of lobbyists. There is the effort to advertise on Facebook. I think everybody ought to be concerned that that was going on. And that has been true from the beginning.BAIER: So on the Uranium One deal, the new wrinkle to that is that an informant, Congress wants to talk to this FBI informant tied to this case, and so far the Department of Justice has squelched it, the ability. And now you have Senator Grassley, Byron, talking about really wanting to talk to this guy, what he knew. I want to play just a little bit. Back when this all came out at first, FOX News was part of the news organizations along with The New York Times, and Peter Schweizer with the book Clinton Cash who first covered this Uranium One tie with the Clinton Foundation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So what happened to Giustra's company that benefited from that deal in Kazakhstan? After a merger it became a uranium giant called Uranium One. And then the Russians bought it.PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR OF 'CLINTON CASH': Uranium One became very active in acquiring uranium assets actually in the United States itself. By 2008, 2009, they were a particularly attractive target for the Russian government.BAIER: And the Russians acquired that target.SCHWEIZER: Fernwood Foundation is an entity in Canada controlled by Ian Telfer who ends up being the chairman of Uranium One, which is the Russian owned uranium company. Ian Telfer in 2007 made an individual contribution to the Clinton Foundation.BAIER: So what this amounts to in the end is a Russian company essentially controlled by Vladimir Putin will now be in charge of a substantial portion of American uranium.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: We had a lot of details, tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, a lot of speaking fees tangentially for former president Clinton. We did an hour long special on it back then. But it has developed since.YORK: It has. And I think what you're saying that with Charles Grassley and the Justice Department is a continuation between -- there's a fight going on between the Republican-controlled Congress and the Republican- controlled Justice Department about all sorts of Russian information. The House Intelligence Committee controlled by Republicans on August 24th subpoenaed the FBI for information about the dossier. They have yet to see a single document. And so it is not really surprising here to see this conflict.One thing on the uranium, a lot of it is framed in terms of the Clintons, but Hillary Clinton argued, and she was right, that she is not the sole person who made this decision about the uranium. There is a committee on foreign investment in the United States and all that.BAIER: Which bring in the Obama administration.YORK: It's a bigger Obama administration story than just Hillary Clinton.LANE: I was going to say another thing we are learning today is that once the special counsel gets going, he never stops.HEMINGWAY: This is something we should've learned a long time ago.LANE: And the Podesta firm is running afoul of that basic Washington principle.BAIER: Last word.HEMINGWAY: Just this is -- we have so much that we need to learn and we have a lot we need to learn about what the FBI's work with this dossier was. Was it used to spy on political opponents? That's a big question that we haven't gotten good answers for. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president wants to see this completed. There's still no evidence of collusion between the president and anyone. If any collusion took place it would be between the DNC and the Clintons. And I think we're now starting to see that all of the things the Democrats had accused this president of doing they were actually guilty of themselves.JEFFREY TOOBIN, THE NEW YORKER: It's a completely political undertaking designed to get people to talk about the only thing that unifies the Republican Party today, which is hating Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well the president, the administration making the case that the Russia investigation really should be about collusion with the Hillary Clinton and the Clinton administration -- the Clinton campaign I should say. The president tweeting It is now commonly agreed after many months of costly looking that there was no collusion between Russia and Trump, was collusion with Hillary Clinton.One of those investigations is the Uranium One investigation where that FBI informant, the gag order was just lifted. And I asked the attorney general about that and how it came to be.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: John Roberts has sources saying the president was involved in the discussion and pushed for that decision. Is that true?JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well I haven't talked to him about that. What I would say is Senator Grassley has been direct with us, for some time. We work with Senator Grassley and are very happy to be able to approve his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.BAIER: But did Don McGahn, White House counsel, or his deputies call you or your people to say the president really wants this to happen?SESSIONS: I have not talked to him about that. But I think it's a good thing that it's worked out I'm very pleased about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So let's bring in our panel: from the Washington bureau, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for The Washington Times; Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, and Eli Lake columnist for Bloomberg View. OK, Julie you heard the attorney general there on that one piece of the investigation. Your thoughts?JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, it's not surprising that the president would want this informant to be freed from a gag order, but it certainly raises questions any time the president is getting involved with Justice Department business. I think that's why you saw Sessions trying to sidestep that question there.Broadly if you look at this week, this is a week where the Trump White House feels like they finally are able to go on the offense on the Russia investigation. They feel like this revelation that Democrats, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, were involved in funding a section of this dossier after a Republican had started this off, puts them on stronger footing.I do think it's really important, though, for people to remember that the reason the Russian investigations exists in the first place isn't because there was a dossier that was funded by opponents of Donald Trump. It exists because there was Russian interference in the election. And the special counsel investigation is there in part because of what we saw transpire around the Comey firing and the fact that you had to have Jeff Sessions recuse himself.So the dossier is important in the sense that it got a lot of attention and it's something that the FBI felt strongly enough about to bring to Donald Trump and to Barack Obama, but it's not the reason that the Russia investigation exist.BAIER: Charlie, the one thing we don't know, and I asked the attorney general and he wouldn't go down this road, is whether the dossier was used for the Fisa court or for the surveillance on the Trump campaign.CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: And of course Julie's right. The dossier is not the reason for these investigations. But it does explain, I think, all of the politics that we're seeing today. Try to imagine that first meeting between Donald Trump and his -- an incoming president and his FBI director where his FBI director pushes across the table this dossier and says, listen, we have this, we know this about you. We have this information on good authority. And the president of the United States is sitting there, looking at the guy going, oh my goodness, this is my FBI director?And that's where their relationship began. And so when you go back to the fact that Comey is ultimately fired, it's amazing that he lasted as long as he did last. How he wasn't fired upon taking office is puzzling to me. So I think that this dossier and all of the new information that's coming out about it really does -- has flipped all of the scripts in Washington. Everything that the Democrats are saying now, the Republicans were saying last week, and vice versa. But clearly there is a lot more that needs to be found out. The most important thing to me is was it the basis for using the government's powerful spying capabilities to spy on a political opponent?BAIER: Yes, I always say in these panels we don't know what we don't know. Eli, your thoughts?ELI LAKE, BLOOMBERG VIEW: I think that it's important in the following sense, which is that the big thing that Bob Mueller and the Justice Department is going to be looking at is did anyone in Trump's orbit work with the Russians add to, distribute, or use these stolen emails during the election? And that's a serious matter.But one of the other issues that's become at least a political story, maybe something that's investigated, are the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had with the Russian lawyer, efforts from Republicans who are close, who were in the sort of Trump orbit to find Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. Well, listen, it's a very simple question. If it's not OK for them to do it, then why is it OK for Democrats to work with a former British spy to then pay for information from senior Russian officials that's damaging for Trump? One is reminded of the old expression about geese and ganders.BAIER: Yes. Really quickly, Julie, this comes on the day when the administration is starting to move forward on Russian sanctions that Congress said it was kind of dragging its feet on. But now it looks like they're moving forward.PACE: The administration sometimes doesn't help themselves when it comes to the questions about Russia. There was this delay on the sanctions where you saw Republicans led by Bob Corker, the president's great friend these days, really trying to push for the administration to follow through on what we saw Congress implement earlier this summer. The administration now has done that. Congress is quite pleased that they're moving forward on this. But again, some of these delays create these question where the administration could really just have helped themselves a little bit more in their handling of these issues. How the president's trip to Asia is going so far The 'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in.  This is a rush transcript from  Special Report with Bret Baier,  November 6, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what has happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.  JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE (through translator): Japan and U.S. are 100 percent together.  BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Should the U.S., do you believe, try to shoot down the next missile that flies over Japan? And so you believe that the U.S. has the capability to do that?  ABE: The United States has a duty to defend Japan if and when Japan is under attack.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)  BAIER: Here in Seoul, South Korea the president's trip continues as you take a look at the map starting in Japan, then here to Seoul and then on to Beijing and China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.  What about this trip and how it is all coming together? Let's bring in our panel: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist; from Washington Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review.  OK, Mara, the importance of this trip, and what do you think the president is trying to come away from the trip with?  MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, the trip is really important. The region is the most important relationship that the U.S. has in the world now and it's some of the biggest challenges. I think the president wants to come out with new wins on trade if he can, some new investments, some countries that are going to buy our weapons.  But I think overarching, much more important than that if he can make some progress on the North Korean situation. He says the era of strategic patience is over. The administration has said that before. But we're not quite sure what will replace that except for tougher sanctions. And we don't know if tougher sanctions are going to budge the North Koreans and get them to give up nuclear weapons which they believe is the key to their survival, the survival of the regime.  BAIER: Jonah, there is a sense here, as I met with the Japanese prime minister and talked to other officials, there is a fear, really, that U.S. will act militarily and that it is going to change this entire region. While they want to get North Korea to the table, there is this skittishness about what is going to happen in coming weeks.  JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Yes. I think Donald Trump's point about the weak rhetoric of the last 25 years is a good one. I think a stronger point would be weak policy. We have had fairly predictable policy for 25 years and that's why North Korea is where it's at. I don't like the way Donald Trump talks about some of these sorts of things, but he has inherited a problem, he hasn't created a problem. And a little unpredictability from the United States putting North Korea back on its heels and China back on its heels might be a good thing. Better to have a little unpredictability then predictable erosion of our national interest, which is what we have had with regard to North Korea for a long time.  BAIER: Mollie?  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: This is a five-country trip. But the first three countries tell us most what had we need to know, and that will be where things are most significant. And each of these first three countries, Japan, South Korean, and China, are going to get a different response from the president, I think. You know one of those things that is very interesting that is shown so clearly in your interview with Prime Minister Abe is this genuine friendship that President Trump has with the prime minister. I'm not sure if anyone really expected that to be the case. They meet frequently, they speak frequently.  President Trump has followed Japan's lead on many of these issues with North Korea, meeting with those families of the victim of the north Koran kidnapping. This is just a very friendly visit. When he moves to when he's now at South Korea, that's a little different. South Korean has shown so much attempt to reach out to China, reaching out to North Korea. We need to make sure that they understand that we do have their back, and we'll be having that kind of conversation.  And when we get to China it's going to be much more emphasis on the need to China and handle the situation in North Korea and letting them be clear about what economic or other means we might use to help them see that that's in their best interest.  BAIER: Mara, you looked at previous administrations and the way they handled foreign policy, and you think is it different from what is happening now? Take a listen to former secretary of state Madeleine Albright talking about the U.S. as a dispensable nation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: What I am worried about is we're about to be the dispensable nation where nobody thinks that we do have a role to play. And I would hope that the president, the current one, would in fact understand that what he is trying to accomplish requires the United States to be engaged in a respectful way, and stop tweeting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: So I guess the question is, has the dynamic changed? Is this administration handling it differently? And to Mollie's point, the relationship between Abe and Trump really could not be closer.  LIASSON: It couldn't be closer. But I think the trickier relationships are South Korea and China. It's hard to see what kind of leverage Donald Trump has with China. He has done a lot of things that have given China stronger hand. Getting out of TPP, that's something China really wanted the United States to do and he did. He hasn't gotten China yet to put on the kind of really crippling sanctions he would like on North Korea. They have done a few things but they haven't really turned the screws enough to make North Korea reconsider its position.  And I think that the question that people have in the region is, what is the United States' plan? Being unpredictable is fine if you have a strategy behind that. And we don't know what the strategy is. You know, he says the era of strategic patience is over. He is going to destroy North Korea if they continue to make nuclear tests, which they have continued to do it. So far that tougher rhetoric that you hear from President Trump hasn't really changed anything yet in North Korea's behavior.  BAIER: Let me push back a little bit here. Here, Jonah, you have the addition of rocket man into the United Nations speech. Obviously that was the sound bite everybody took. And he has since talked about it numerous other times. Since then you've seen China move off the ball further than they have previously as far as financing and other things. Could they do more? Yes. But the people in this region say they have seen more movement than they have seen in the past two administrations.  GOLDBERG: I think that's right. The history of our pressuring China to do something about North Korea is that when we're paying attention to what China is doing, China plays ball. And then when we get distracted by something else, and this is true under Obama, it was true under Bush, it was true under Clinton, then China then stops putting pressure on North Korea.  Ultimately what I would like to see is the reunification of the Korean peninsula but that's a big lift. It seems to me a good plan b would be essentially the Finlandization China's problem. It should be China's problem. The United States should make it clear that it is China's problem. We now know that North Korea cannot be an honest broker with the United States. It hasn't been for 25 years, and rocket man is not a reliable partner. But China can be. And so that requires putting an enormous amount of pressure on China to actually take some ownership of North Korea. And so far there have been steps in the right direction there, but this is a long term serious work of state craft, and it remains to be seen whether this administration or any administration can pull it off.  BAIER: Let me mention this other form of diplomacy that the president is working on here, and that is economic diplomacy. He talked about at the state dinner at Japan about what he was looking for.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I have enjoyed every minute of it, even though he's a very, very tough negotiator.  (LAUGHTER)  TRUMP: Right now our trade with Japan is not free and it's not reciprocal. And I know it will be.  I have to say, for the last many decades Japan has been winning. You do know that. Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over, is that possible to ask? That's not rude. Is that rude? I don't think so.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: So, he's doing it a little differently than other leaders have, Mollie?  HEMINGWAY: There is nothing that says that says that if we have free trade agreements that they must be permanent. It's fine to renegotiate things and make sure that things are working out in this country's best interest. But economic diplomacy is actually a great method in this region, which is why, as Mara pointed out, getting out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a unwise move and that it was one of our better means to working with some of these countries. But there is certainly more that can be done with China, and they have benefited so much from the global economy, and they have not really stepped up as a global player that matches with how much they have benefited from that. So this focus on economic repercussions, for failure to rein in bad actors is a great approach.  LIASSON: Yes, except for what's he going to do --  BAIER: Mara, final word.  LIASSON: Yes. I'm just wondering, what is the leverage? What is the stick that Donald Trump is saying that he is going to use? He is asking them to build more cars in the U.S. He knows that they already build some. What is he going to do if they don't?  HEMINGWAY: In China there are quite a few things that you could do. There are so many American companies that are based there and there is a lot of leverage that can be done there. China doesn't want to lose its American investments.  BAIER: Panel, thank you.

The tone of President Trump's visit to Las Vegas The 'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in.  This is a rush transcript from  Special Report with Bret Baier,  October 4, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The officers were standing up the line of fire to help those in danger and to find out where those horrible shots were coming from. Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night.  The message that I have is we have a great country and we are there for you. And they are there for us.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gun violence program?  TRUMP: We're not going to talk about that today.  REP. ROBIN KELLY, D-ILL.: Thoughts and prayers while they head to the bank to cash their NRA check.  SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHARLES SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: We cannot, we cannot let this tragedy, this American tragedy, another in a long line of American tragedies, fall out of our hearts and minds too quickly.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)  BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: After the tragedy, calls on Capitol Hill for some action, some different than others, but what's really gaining some momentum it seems is the so-called bump stocks that the Las Vegas shooter used to turn a semiautomatic rifle into a near machine gun, to ban those. They were legalized by the ATF during the Obama administration. And now lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are looking at that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.: At the very least, back a bill that stops the killer accelerators like the bump stocks. This device has no purpose but to convert an already deadly weapon into a completely lethal carnage force multiplier.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: Do you think that Congress should look into see if perhaps they should be outlawed?  REP. TOM COLE, R-OLKA.: I think there is no question we ought to look into that.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)  BAIER: So with that, let's bring in our panel: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist; Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary, and Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at USA Today. OK, Mollie, what about this momentum on Capitol Hill for something?  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: Right. Well at least in this case we are talking about something that was involved in this actual deadly incident which is not usually the case when we go through this ritual of talking about gun control after any deadly event.  And that is something we do to make ourselves feel better about the fact that no amount of gun regulation is going to prevent people who are hell- bent on murdering people from doing so. And we have learned that through so many terrorist incidents involving planes, trucks, fertilizer, and any number of other things. So we are pretending where having a debate about gun control, but we are really having a debate about the nature of evil and whether a big enough government can contain it.  BAIER: Ari?  ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, normally when this happens, you hear people say why can't we do something? What can we do to stop it? I don't blame people for having that reaction. It's a humane reaction. This is what you do when something goes wrong. You say how do we stop it from ever happening again?  I do think you have to pause, learn what we can from this and not rush into it because that minimized the politicization of it. But the broader point here about automatic weapon fire, whether it's the barrel stocks or whatever it is, we do not want to be a nation where you get your hands on a machine gun and use it. So I think there will be some coming together along those lines and I would like to see it.  The thing I would like to see less of, frankly, is what Secretary Clinton tweeted this morning about silencers. It has absolutely nothing to do with this and is a distortion of the debate about what really suppressors do because you can still hear the gunshot just like it's a jackhammer. So when something goes wrong like this, you hate to see the politicians rush in to make hay. What you do want to see is people try to find some reasonable solution. I think in this case there can be one for automatic weapons.  BAIER: There is, Susan, an interesting development with the politics of it. If you not at Republicans but at Democrats, The National Journal pointing out that six red state Senate Democrats, largely representing rural states, up for reelection in 2018, not one came out for more gun control in the wake of the Vegas killings. West Virginia's Joe Manchin cosponsored bipartisan legislation expanding the scope of background checks has been notably quiet. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota voted against that background check bill, has no interest in bringing up gun control in the run up to her reelection campaign. And Senator Claire McCaskill, the most liberal of the bunch, says National Journal, simple released an anodyne statement calling the Vegas attack evil and offering support for law enforcement. She knows the politics of Missouri better than the armchair pundits who insist that gun control is a slam dunk issue. It's an interesting take, those election concerns.  SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY: I think Democrats have concluded it's not a slam dunk issue, that even though you can look at polling on something like background check and see that eight or nine out of 10 American support that, gun control is an issue that has hurt Democrats running for office.  And what surprised me in the wake of this particular terrible tragedy was the lack of a fervid debate. Remember after Sandy Hook, a huge debate, even after the Orlando Pulse shootings, Democrats took over the floor of Congress to talk about it for a day. You didn't see that here. You get the feeling that this is not something Democrats are actually going to pursue in an aggressive way.  And I'll tell you, I have one question about the bump stock issue of which there is some conversation. The NRA has had a no step is permissible attitude because it's a slippery slope. That's been I think their general argument. Will the NRA endorse this legislation?  BAIER: That is a great question, Mollie. Is there a point where some give has to be given?  HEMINGWAY: I think certainly there are all sorts of proposals that are out there where this could be part of a compromise, for instance, on allowing suppressors, not silencers. We talk about these things and we don't really know about it.  Background checks, by the way, I just want to point out, we already do background checks and almost everyone who purchases --  PAGE: Gun shows, the gun show loophole.  HEMINGWAY: There's not actually a gun show loophole. But that's one of the things that I think is probably a problem here is so many people who are talking about these issues clearly aren't people who use and fire weapons and many people in the country do.  BAIER: Yes, but my point is, does the NRA come off, is there some offer? Does President Trump somehow negotiate something with his friends with the NRA to come off on something?  HEMINGWAY: It's entirely possible because this is the kind of thing that a lot of people who fire weapons don't care that much about relative to other issues, so it could be part of a compromise. What I would encourage people to be understanding of is you can simulate a rapid fire just using a belt loop. You don't actually need one of these things. You can also with 3D printing, there's no way we are actually going to be able to control evil people who want to use tool to commit mass murder, and that's something we also have to think of because there are issues.  One of the things about this guy is he's the latest murderer who grew up in a fatherless home. It's very difficult to deal with that societal crisis of how most people who are in our prisons, most people who have severe problems grow up in fatherless homes. But this would be something that a lot of people could work on that could pay dividends in the future.  BAIER: It's interesting you point to the shooter. This is the president talking about the Las Vegas gunman today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I can tell you it's a very sick man. He was a very demented person. We haven't seen that yet, but you will know very soon if we find something. We are looking very, very hard.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: And Ari, he was pressed about that by the pool before he got on Marine One. He said it's going to come out soon. So maybe he's kind of foreshadowing whatever the police are learning.  FLEISCHER: Typically the president would get a briefing on what information they have found in the course of an investigation and asking him not to reveal it yet because they don't want to compromise that information as more comes in. So he might know something. I think it's clear already if it was terrorism we all would have known it so I don't think -- that's probably ruled out.  But let me go back to a point Mollie was making earlier where this is going legislatively. Don't look for a Chuck-Nancy deal on this one. This is not going to be that type of compromise. If there is something to be legislated it's going to be incredibly narrow. I think it's going to be something that could garner virtually unanimous support on Capitol Hill, all aimed, again, at just automatic weapon fire.  There was a fascinating op-ed in The Washington Post this morning by a woman described as a statistician and a former news writer at Five Thirty Eight, the website, Leah Libresco. She said I'm not convinced gun control, I'm sorry, her headline on the story was  I used to think gun control was the answer. My research told me otherwise.  It was fascinating, detailed read, nonpartisan. And I think it's why the Democrats aren't going to push for a fight on this. They don't have the facts on their side as the statistician --  BAIER: I want to turn to the next panel, but Representative Carlos Curbelo from Florida is writing a bill on bump stock and has bipartisan support.

The Trump administration on defense over Puerto Rico Critics claim federal response to Hurricane Maria has been uneven; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel.This is a rush transcript from Special Report with Bret Baier, September 28, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)LT. GEN. RUSSEL HONORE, U.S. ARMY (RET): The president has shown again you don't give a damn about poor people, you don't give a damn about people of color. A SOB that rides around in Air Force One is denying services needed by the people of Puerto Rico. I hate to say it that way but there's no other way to say it.RICARDO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICAN GOVERNOR: The reality is that the administration and the president, every time that we've spoken, that I've asked, they have delivered to us. This morning, late last night I asked for a waiver on the Jones Act. And late this morning the president accepted that waiver.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Two very different takes on the federal response to Puerto Rico, Russel Honore and the current governor of Puerto Rico. This as the president tweeted today, The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on the island. Food and water on site. As you take a look at our new poll, FOX poll on the president's handling, approval, disapproval. And on the top of the chart, hurricanes, approve 60 percent, disapprove 31 percent. You can see the other issues there, health care wrapping out on the bottom, upside down 35 to 58.With that, let's bring in our panel: Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano; Amy Walter, national editor for The Cook Political Report; and Byron York, chief political correspondent of the Washington Examiner.What about the response in Puerto Rico? You heard the interview with Tom Bossert and what they are doing and what the tough thing is to get the material through the island of Puerto Rico.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS: I've been watching this all day and even on some of the other networks. I am fixated with Geraldo Rivera who just is living amidst this and is painting a very, very bleak picture.I think that General Honore, who of course was in charge of the rescue efforts in Katrina, was unduly harsh and personal with respect to the president. But there is the perception, and it is based upon on the ground reporting by Geraldo and others, that the president is more interested in other things, certainly was more interested in Irma and Harvey, than he has been in the catastrophe that has become Puerto Rico.Can he recover from this? Yes, he can. He's had a very bad week because of domestic political events, but sticking to the Puerto Rican story, the impression is too little, too late, too below the radar screen for this White House.BAIER: Amy?AMY WALTER, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: Yes. And I think it started again, with the first tweets that came from the president seemed to put a lot of the blame on Puerto Rico itself, the talk about this is a country -- Puerto Rico itself, not a separate country, of course, but it's a territory that is struggling. It has bankruptcy. It has problems with its infrastructure. And then it was only after that that the discussion turned to here is the help that we are giving.There are some logistical challenges to getting aid to an island. There's no doubt about that. But the challenge, this is what President Bush found and this president is finding as well. When people are reporting from these scene and you with your very own eyes as a viewer can see just what it looks like to be there, you instantly ask why the government isn't doing a better job.BAIER: Yes. First of all, I think Twitter loses nuance.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: And I think he was trying to perhaps say that the big problems in Puerto Rico are multiplied exponentially because of the situation they had prior going in. Understood the implication there. What they are doing now, is it getting enough to balance out with the feeling is on the ground as far as the public sentiment about Puerto Rico?BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Clearly not, people who are needing help and aren't getting it. Obviously they are not getting what they need.But I don't think the White House fully appreciated the incredible logistical nightmare that this actually is. And obviously there have been efforts. We see all of these containers that are piling up that have not been distributed, but they got there. So I think clearly it took a few days to realize that this was something beyond the capabilities of a normal response. And this is most important because of the substance of it. People need help.But politically that number you showed was really quite impressive, 60 percent of the people approve of Trump's handling of the two earlier hurricanes. That's 11 percent more than any other topic for him.WALTER: Yes, but I think, to that point, that was for the earlier hurricanes. I'm very curious to see what those numbers are a week from now when we ask that question.BAIER: Let's turn to taxes. Here's the vice president and Gary Cohn and some Democrats talking about tax reform.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Before we get to Christmas of this year, we are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, and we are going to get America going again.(APPLAUSE)GARY COHN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We think we can pay for the entire tax cut through growth over the cycle.SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: If you use that funny kind of math at Goldman Sachs the way he's using it here in Washington, he would've been kicked out of that firm a long time ago.COHN: Wealthy Americans are not getting a tax cut.SCHUMER: Please. Let's have some honesty.SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: Lying is a growth industry around here. I really like Chuck, but when it comes to tax reform, our bill, he is going through a phase. It's called brain dead.(END VIDEO CLIPS)(LAUGHTER)BAIER: All right, some thoughts about taxes as we start to get the details, they will be worked out on Capitol Hill, Judge.NAPOLITANO: This is one of the major events that Donald Trump has been waiting that he pushed during the campaign. They did not succeed, as we all know, try as they did with respect to the Affordable Care Act. He promised a huge tax cut, one that would cause a sort of reshaping of the tax landscape. I was hoping for the postcard size tax return, and apparently that will be the case for many Americans but not for all of us.Do I like everything in there? No. Do I like the concept, the principle of a huge tax cut so as to regenerate the economy? Absolutely. Do I think it will pass? Yes. I think even my small government buddies in congress, particularly in the House who do not want to be the deficit increase will vote for this tax cut.BAIER: And the Freedom Caucus has already kind of sign-on but we don't know the details yet.YORK: The problem with this is the whole discussion is hypothetical. If you listen to Gary Cohn today, he said we are going to cut middle-class taxes, although people were coming up with scenarios under the framework in which this or that middle class family would pay more in taxes.BAIER: State and local deductions.YORK: Exactly. If you take the seven brackets down to three, where are the lines between those brackets? The child tax credit, how much is that going to be? He's going to have to come up with a lot more to satisfy a number of conservative Republicans who want to make up the gap and want it to be family friendly as. So the problem with this discussion now is everything is on the level of hypothetical.BAIER: And quickly, because I want to save it for Secretary Price's panel on the second panel here, but Amy, that is the question. We could see a lot of changes in this thing from the original rollout. The death tax could not be totally eliminated and perhaps, who knows, a one percent payroll tax cut, something could be put in there that hits the middle class more than it does now.WALTER: And this is the other challenge which is what Republicans had going into the health care debate. There are mixed messages coming from Congress and from the president. Nobody really sold it. All the discussion was really process oriented and really focused on getting individual members to vote for it. Nobody sold it to the public. This is going to take an effort not just getting the votes but making the case that this is going to help regular people. And when it comes to taxes, people know it instantly, right. You're going to get your tax bill and you're going to know whether you got a cut or whether you got an increase. You can't just spin your way out of this.But being able to make that case, Democrats being against this are going to be unified in their message. They can be very disciplined on that. Can Republicans be disciplined in selling it?BAIER: And 88 percent want small business and middle class to get tax cuts.Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Trump rejects bipartisan deal on ObamaCare subsidiesThe 'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in.This is a rush transcript from Special Report with Bret Baier, October 18, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Has the White House been involved in those negotiations, and will you support that deal?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes, we have been involved, and this is a short-term deal because we think ultimately block grants going to the states is going to be the answer. That's a very good solution.While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray, and I do commend it, I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the ObamaCare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.If something can happen, that's fine, but I won't do anything to enrich the insurance companies.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: OK, so we are trying to figure out exactly where President Trump, the administration are on the Lamar Alexander-Patty Murray bill. It was seen as a temporary fix to ObamaCare while a bigger fix, a repeal and replace, is still being worked on.The president tweeting today, I am supportive of Lamar as a person and also of the process, but I can never support bailing out insurance companies who have made a fortune with O-care.With that, let's bring in our panel: Steve Hilton is former adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and host of The Next Revolution here on Fox News Channel; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of No Labels Radio on Sirius XM, and Byron York, chief political correspondent of the Washington Examiner. You just have one title. It's very simple.BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: That's me.BAIER: Byron, is there an evolution here? Do you think he felt pushback from conservatives? What do you think happened?YORK: Both of those things. I think he found out more of what was in this Murray-Alexander agreement, and it got a very bad reaction from a lot of conservatives, policy wonks and others. And also it was pretty clear last night one of those sound bites you played was from the speech he gave at the Heritage Foundation last night, and he made it very clear that he wasn't going to go with any sort of bailout. So I think he just spoke off- the-cuff yesterday when he said he supported this, and now he simply commends the two for making this effort.BAIER: Here is Senator Alexander on the compromise leading up to what he says are conservative victories.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER, R-TENN.: This is what we need to do in the meantime. It gives us a few steps toward what we most want which are more options for the states to give people choices of insurance at lower costs. There are more victories for conservatives in the Alexander-Murray compromise than we've had eight years of arguing about ObamaCare.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: But a guy who likes compromise sometimes, speaker Paul Ryan, through a spokesperson says the speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of ObamaCare. So it seems, A.B., that we are back to square one.A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Yes. Actually the president did lead Senator Alexander on and talked to him over the weekend. I'm sure you've all read the quote. He said I don't want those people to suffer. Lamar Alexander felt that he could come out and actually say that out loud. Lamar Alexander doesn't give a lot of interviews, doesn't talk to the press very much. He was encouraged to find a way to not have FOX News go into a county in April of 2018 that Trump won where people say my whole life took a bad turn in November of 2017 after those CSR payments were cut. He knew exactly what this was going to do.I was told last week he was in a meeting with a foreign policy, national security official at the White House, spent the entire meeting trying to drive the conversation back to a health care deal. He wants this behind him.But he had pressure from his crowd last night. He had pressure from Mark Meadows of the Freedom Caucus actually spoke pretty positively about this deal, and he backed off. They don't have the votes for repeal. The Republican Party of 2017 who are seated in Congress are not going to repeal this law.So I thought that his opening gambit was good yesterday, which was let's do this and then we'll get to our own thing later on. But he's blowing up the process. The House problem solvers caucus that came up with this first plan which is the predicate for the Murray-Alexander thing has a few more things in it that Republicans would like, including a medical device tax repeal and some other things. There's a little more there that could happen. But not if Paul Ryan and the leaders are saying let's go back to repeal, which they all know is an illusion.BAIER: They may not even bring up the bill. It's the leadership's decision whether to bring it up or not. Let's just talk broadly, Steve, about governing and working with lawmakers and an executive, and the trust level of the ying and yang of you have to believe that you're going to be backed up at some point to go out on a limb to push something.STEVE HILTON, FORMER DAVID CAMERON ADVISER: Yes, I think that's right. And I think that there's also a really big question here on strategy that isn't being handled right. I've said many times here with you, Bret, that the really big thing the president was elected to do was to get the economy moving, to get jobs and incomes, and that is the thing he seems to understand the best. We are going to talk about it later I know.All of this is a diversion from the big thing that he needs to do. Every time they go in, they seem to get bogged down in it. You're right that they don't have the votes. That's why I was encouraged to see that there may be an attempt, exactly as you were saying, I completely agree. This felt encouraging, felt like he was learning the ropes a bit in terms of working with others, giving them encouragement. But now it feels like, again, step back. It's just not -- and all of it is wasting time and energy that really should be focused on the economic.BAIER: We should point out also that Lindsey Graham and others have said even if the Cassidy-Graham bill was passed, it was still take a couple years to be implemented to do these block grants to states for that repeal and replace version.YORK: That was just a step for the Senate. The House had passed a bill, and the Cassidy-Graham bill was not going to be anything like it, so we were still going to be a long way away. But I think for Republicans, I think you just have to remember, it is taking a while to soak in about how catastrophic this ObamaCare failure was. The reason there's all this tension about tax reform right now is the basis of that is we screwed up ObamaCare, and if we mess up on taxes this will be a total disaster and we'll lose our job next year.So this is not something that's gone away. And what the president did with this order to cut off these CSR subsidies is put the pressure on Congress to actually do something. And they are feeling it, and that's why we had the Murray-Alexander thing.BAIER: We talk about the constitutionality question about the subsidy payments and Congress had to appropriate all of that. I do want to turn to the other thing that got a lot of attention today and it seems like every day there is something that is the shiny thing that gets our attention. But this is about the condolence calls.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. FREDERICA WILSON, D-FLA.: I'm not trying to prove anything with the president. So the president evidently is lying, because what I said is true. I have no reason to lie on the president of the United States with a dead soldier in my community.TRUMP: I didn't say what that congresswoman said, didn't say it at all. She knows it, and she now is not saying it. I did not say what she said. And I'd like her to make the statement again, because I did not say what she said.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are there recordings of a phone call with Major Johnson?SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: No, but there were several people in the room from the administration that were on the call, including the chief of staff General John Kelly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: This is a call to the widow of someone who died, a soldier who died in Niger. And now you have all of these news organizations going after all these gold star families who did or did not get calls or letters from the president. The Associated Press, A.P., found relatives of four soldiers who died overseas during Trump's presidency who said they never received calls from him. Relatives of two also confirmed they did not get letters after her army son died in an armored vehicle rollover in Syria in May. Sheila Murphy says she got no call or letter from President Trump even as she waited months for his condolences and wrote him that some days I don't want to live. Steve, this is just so heart-wrenching to be in the public, period.HAYES: You are right. That's exactly how I feel about it. It is just so sad in every single way, sad for the family, sad that this is what our political debate has come to, chasing after this story. If there was some deeper truth at the bottom of this that it was important to get out there about something nefarious that the government or the administration or the president had done, fine. But actually I don't think there's anyone who really believes President Trump doesn't really take seriously the honor of the military, that he is somehow unpatriotic or doesn't care about these people.BAIER: It was the president who brought up these calls and who called and who didn't in presidents of past and whether they did or did not. But it's going to go down this road, and it's going to continue like this if he --STODDARD: I think it's terrible for every military family and gold star family in this country to watch and listen to any of this. It's extremely upsetting and it's offensive. The president started this on Monday. He was asked a question about the ambush in Niger and why it's taken two weeks for us to find out about it. Reports are that James Mattis, the secretary of defense, is still trying to look for answers about -- that's really concerning. But Trump turned this into some untrue accusation about former presidents, to which a Twitter onslaught began, proving that what he said was false. He doubled down today. He might have stumbled over his words and said the wrong thing. What he did today made it a lot worse. And he has a terrible record on gold star families. He needs to spare this one group of people.BAIER: Last word.YORK: I think you have to separate, there's two things. One, he made a terrible mistake bringing up Obama and previous presidents at the press conference. That was a dumb thing to do. As far as this stuff with Sergeant Johnson's family is concerned, we do have a member of Congress who has talked about his impeachment several months ago, just stirring this thing up. And it's not entirely clear what the president said and whether it was disrespectful or not.BAIER: The broad point being all of it is horrific. We have to cover it because it's news, but it's bad.Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
